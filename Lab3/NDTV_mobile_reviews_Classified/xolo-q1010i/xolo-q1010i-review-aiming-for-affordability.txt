Xolo Q1010i Review: Aiming for Affordability

Intel
 collaborated with Xolo to bring out one of the first Intel-powered 
Android phones - the X900 - around two years ago. Ever since then, Xolo 
has tried to position itself as a premium yet affordable smartphone 
brand. Compared to the other brands that operate in its price range, 
including the 800 pound gorilla Samsung, Xolo makes phones that seem 
like good value options. Their newest smartphone, the Q1010i, is 
an upgrade to the Xolo Q1010 and comes with the promise of a competent 
camera featuring Sony's Exmor R sensor. Its closest competitor is the 
mighty Moto G. We put it through its paces to find out which one will 
come out on top.Design, Features and SpecificationsThis 
unassuming black slab of a smartphone tries to avoid being too boring by
 introducing a chrome trim along the edges, and a matte rear cover which
 also provides a good grip. Despite its large screen, Xolo has managed 
to keep the device compact with uniform weight distribution, and we 
found that it fit well in our hands. Reaching the top of the screen with
 our thumbs was easy too. On the left edge is a thin volume 
rocker and on the right edge is the power button. A 3.5mm jack and 
micro-USB port are on the top and bottom edges respectively. Right below
 the screen is a three-button capacitive setup for navigation. The 
buttons are coloured grey, and are not too visible against the black 
body of the phone. Above the display are the earpiece, front camera, 
hidden notification LED, and array of sensors. Once we pried open the 
rear cover, we found the non-removable 2250mAh battery, and two 
micro-SIM card slots, and a micro-SD card slot. The 5-inch 720p 
screen on the Xolo Q1010i has a density of 299ppi. This is a really good
 screen and almost rivals the Moto G's razor sharp display. Text is 
crisp and images spring to life. Under direct sunlight, the screen's 
legibility is good. Even the viewing angles are pretty good. Under
 the hood is a Mediatek MT6589 1.3GHz quad-core processor with 
integrated Mali-400MP2 graphics. There is 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal
 storage on the Q1010i, which is a bump up from the Q1010's 4GB. 
Moreover, the 8-megapixel camera now features Sony's Exmor R sensor with
 an f/2.0 aperture. There is no change to the specification of the front
 camera. It is the same 2-megapixel unit seen on the Q1010.SoftwareAnother
 salient feature of Xolo phones is that apart from adding a few extra 
apps, the core Android operating system is mostly untouched. The Q1010i 
runs Android 4.2 but the company has promised an update to Android 4.4.2
 (Kitkat). In fact, we did receive the message for a software update 
during the course of our review but for some odd reason we couldn't 
download it. There's nothing new to be said about 4.2, which we have 
covered in great detail before. However, we'd like to take a look at the
 additional apps that are present. Apart from the slew of common 
Google apps, there are three Xolo branded apps. Xolo Care provides users
 with options to call, SMS or email a customer care executive to solve 
any issues with the phone. This substantiates Xolo's initiative to 
provide better customer service. For battery performance management, 
there is a Xolo Power app. Xolo Secure can configure anti-theft features
 and also provides a backup and restore feature for messages, call logs 
and contacts, but needs you to link your Google account. All three apps 
are really useful in our opinion. CameraWe doubt there is a
 single phone in this price range with a competent camera. Keeping that 
in mind, Xolo has made a smart move by fitting the Q1010i with an 
8-megapixel Sony Exmor R sensor, which is supposed to perform better in 
low light. Let's find out if it can deliver.In our daylight 
testing, the camera captured really good images with very low noise 
levels. Sony's camera sensors are typically inclined towards slight 
oversaturation, which makes colours pop. Sure enough, the images we 
captured with this phone had slightly exaggerated colours too. A lot of 
people will like this, but remember that the colours are not really 
natural. In low light, the camera manages to focus and capture 
decent images. Of course there is quite a bit of noise, and if you 
aren't steady while taking photos, you'll probably end up with blurred 
images. Even so, the camera on the Xolo Q1010i is far ahead of its 
competition. In fact, even 1080p video taken with this phone has great 
detail and colour. On the other hand, no matter how much we tried, we always ended with smudged images on the 2-megapixel front camera. For
 all the camera's capabilities, it's a pity that Xolo didn't innovate 
with the camera app. It is the same one from the days of Android 2.3 
(Gingerbread). Thankfully, there are very good replacement apps in the 
Play Store.PerformanceTill now, it's been all hunky dory 
for the Xolo Q1010i, so there has to be a caveat somewhere right? Well, 
the benchmark numbers were far below our expectations. The phone 
scored 17,055 and 5,874 in AnTuTu and Quadrant, respectively, which is 
fairly okay. Things go downhill with the graphics benchmark scores. The 
intense GFXbench and 3DMark Ice Storm tests returned dismal scores of 
6.6fps and 2973 points. Quite clearly, the Mali-400 MP2 is insufficient 
for the Xolo Q1010i. The cheaper Micromax Unite 2 has the same SoC but a
 lower resolution screen, which explains why its graphics scores are 
much better. The HD screen on the Xolo Q1010i is probably too much for 
this hardware to handle. In real-world usage, we found that 
scrolling through the homescreens was smooth and apps opened fairly fast
 too. The performance issue was most apparent when we tried to play 
full-HD videos. The phone tried playing them with all its muscle power, 
but really struggled. Low-resolution videos played fine. This is a 
letdown because in this regard, the Q1010i cannot hold a candle to the 
Moto G which screams through HD videos. The battery life is good, 
though, and the phone lasted us seven hours and 13 minutes in our video 
loop test. Voice call clarity is good too. VerdictIf you 
need the best possible camera and have a budget of Rs. 15,000, the Xolo 
Q0101i is clearly the smartphone to consider. In every other department,
 the Moto G is superior. Buyers should also take a look at Lava's 
stylish Iris Pro 30 and its younger sibling, the Iris Pro 20.
