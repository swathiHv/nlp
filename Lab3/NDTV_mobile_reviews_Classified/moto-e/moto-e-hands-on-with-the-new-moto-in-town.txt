Moto E: Hands on With the New 'Moto' in Town

Few handsets have seen the kind of speculation that preceded the launch of the Moto E.Motorola
 officially outed its next big thing at a small price - the Moto E - at launch events in 
Delhi and London on Tuesday. Instead of an upscale announcement that we 
usually see with other handset makers, the Moto E launch more laid back,
 with the company talking about the reception that Moto G and Moto X received.Hot on the 
heels of the Moto G and Moto X, the Moto E has been priced smartly to 
take on the dominant players such as Micromax, Lava, Samsung and Xolo in
 the sub-Rs. 10,000 category. Motorola has unveiled the Moto E in India 
carrying a price 
tag of Rs. 6,999 and it is now available in India exclusively via 
online retailer Flipkart, just like the other two Motos.It's 
worth noting that HTC also made waves with the affordable HTC Desire 210
 Dual SIM, while Sony and Samsung have populars 
offering in the sub-Rs. 10,000 segment, with the Sony Xperia E1 
Dual and Samsung Galaxy S Duos 2.While hardware might not Moto E's strongest aspect on paper, 
the company hopes the pricing and the software features will be its key 
selling points in a market like India.In addition, Flipkart, has 
introduced launch day offers on Moto E, similar to what it did with the Moto G 
and Moto X. Consumers willing to buy the Moto E on Wednesday can get a 
50 percent discount on the purchase of covers and 8GB Transcend microSD 
card. Flipkart is also offering free ebooks worth Rs 1,000 on the 
opening day.Build, design and displayConfirming many 
previous rumours, Motorola decided to stick to its tried and tested 
formula when it came to Moto E's appearance. The Moto E looks strikingly
 similar to the Moto G at first glance, the back panel in particular. 
The Moto E's rear is curved and is made of a soft-touch polycarbonate, 
and which is comfortable to hold. The front panel of Moto E however has 
differences when compared to the Moto G, which now sports two speaker 
grilles on top and bottom of the front panel with a chrome tone.The
 Moto E with dimensions 124.8x64.8x12.3mm and weight 142 grams is 
thicker and heavier than the Moto G which comes with 129.9x65.9x11.6mm 
dimensions and weighs 140 grams. However, for an average buyer in this 
price segment, thickness and weight of a smartphone are not the biggest 
concerns.The front panel features a black strip of glass around 
the screen that visually differentiates the plastic front and rear 
panels, very similar to the Moto G and Moto X. The power and volume 
rocker buttons are placed on the right side of the Moto E, while the 
3.5mm audio jack is on the top and the Micro-USB port is on the bottom. 
Looking at the Moto E, it seems Motorola wants to align the industrial 
design of its products.The Moto E's back houses a 5-megapixel camera without any flash, while the Motorola logo is embossed just below the camera.The
 Moto E, like its predecessor, features switchable colourful back 
panels; although the battery is non-removable. Peel off the rear cover 
and you get access to the two SIM slots, which accept Micro-SIMs. 
Thankfully - and this addresses perhaps the biggest complaint with the 
Moto G - a microSD card slot is also present.The Moto E comes with
 4.3-inch display with a qHD (540x960 pixels) resolution, and offers 
256ppi pixel density. Motorola has again used Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on
 the new Moto E, which is also found on the Moto G to protect it from 
scratches. The company used nano-coating on the Moto G that acted as 
light water repellent, while this one feature a water-resistant splash 
guard, Motorola claims.Specifications, software and performanceThe
 Moto E is powered by a 1.2GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 
processor along with Adreno 302 GPU and 1GB of RAM. It comes with 4GB 
built-in storage (2.1GB user-accessible), while also supports expandable
 storage up to 32GB via microSD card.(Also see: Moto E vs. Moto G)In
 our brief time spent with the phone, we found that navigating across 
the menu and opening and switching apps was quite smooth. Thanks to the 
1GB of RAM, the phone appeared to handle most of the multitasking with 
ease. Performance wise, the Moto E fared well in our limited testing.The
 Moto E runs Android 4.4 KitKat out-of-the-box and the company 
guarantees at least one major update for the handset in future. The 
latest Android software of the Moto E is another feature that gives the 
handset a clear advantage in the affordable smartphone segment. The Moto
 E is now the first handset to reach Indian market with Android 4.4 
KitKat out-of-the-box in the sub-Rs. 10,000 segment.The 
smartphone comes with a number of bells and whistles in terms of 
software. Motorola has preloaded apps such as Motorola Migrate, which 
helps in moving the contents of an old Android phone to your new Moto E 
and Motorola Assist, which allows users to silence the device while 
sleeping or driving.The company also introduced its new Motorola 
Alert app, which is now also available for download via Google Play.
 The app alerts people close to you, when needed. User's need to switch 
on the alert app on the phone and it starts sending periodic 
notifications with location to the people you designate. For example you
 can designate it to let your family know when you reach or leave your 
school or office.CameraThe Moto E sports a 5-megapixel 
rear camera and is capable of capturing FVWGA (480x854 pixels 
resolution) video. The camera interface of Moto E is similar to the one 
seen on Moto G. Unfortunately, there is no front-facing camera or rear 
flash. While for some the absence of front camera won't be a problem, 
but for selfie-lovers, it might be a nightmare!In our limited 
camera testing we noticed that images clicked in well-lit conditions had
 vibrant colours but a bit of noise around the edges - we will have to 
put the Moto E camera through the paces during our detailed review to 
find out more about this shooter.Final wordsIt would be 
naive to say that the Moto E is perfect. There are concerns like the 
absence of front-facing camera and no flash. The performance of the rear
 camera needs to be tested in detail and while 'only' a dual-core 
processor might disappoint those obsessed with specs, Motorola will 
point to 1GB RAM at a price that usually sees only smartphones with 
512MB RAM.What makes the Moto E special is the fact that it is 
the only smartphone in the sub-Rs. 10,000 segment to run Android 4.4 
out-of-the-box. Overall, the Moto E appears a decent package with its 
latest Android offering and dual-SIM functionality.You can expect more detailed observations and testing when we review the Moto E. Motorola Moto E: First look
