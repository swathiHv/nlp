Samsung Galaxy S5 review: Signs that we may have reached 'Peak smartphone'

Car
 manufacturers rely on periodic cosmetic refreshes and price cuts to 
keep customers interested as new completion enters the market. You might
 see a new grille, or some minor change to the moulded plastic bits. A 
few accessories that used to be optional extras might come preinstalled,
 and the upholstery might be a little more premium. Other than that, 
it's essentially the same model.Smartphone manufacturers, on the 
other hand, have forced themselves into a yearly refresh cycle. Whether 
or not there's anything new to offer, they must launch a new model. It's
 beginning to feel a little forced, especially since top-end smartphones
 already have more power than most people know what to do with.So,
 when Samsung unveiled the new Galaxy S5 at this year's Mobile World 
Congress, the world let out a collective yawn. Sure, it has a few new 
features and some nifty accessories, but is it really that different 
from last year's model? As it turns out, the answer to that question 
isn't a simple yes or no. Read on to find out why.Look and FeelIt's
 pretty easy to spot a Samsung phone these days. The company hasn't 
deviated from its formula for a long time now, and at least from the 
front, the S5 looks like every other currently available Samsung phone. 
It has a silver border around the edges, sunken white faceplate with a 
textured pattern (simple dots this time), silver-ringed physical Home 
button flanked by soft buttons for Recents and Back, and earpiece and 
visible sensors on top. The Galaxy S5's look isn't all repetitive
 though - the chrome ring around the edges has two little ridges, while 
the back is an all-new satiny plastic with a grid of dots for texture. 
That's right, Samsung has finally deviated from the fake 
leather-and-stitching look that until just now had threatened to spread 
through the company's entire product line. We're happy to report that in
 person, the rear panel looks nothing like a band-aid - as suggested by 
some critics.The power button is on the right edge, as expected, 
with the volume rocker opposite. There's a 3.5mm headset socket and IR 
emitter on the top, along with an additional mic for noise cancellation.
 The only things on the bottom are a tiny mic and the rather large 
Micro-USB 3.0 port, protected by a rubber-ringed flap. Although the 
Galaxy S5 is capable of USB 3.0 transfer speeds, Samsung provides only a
 regular USB 2.0 cable in the box. This isn't a huge problem, but since 
the port is oversized, recessed, and covered, you need to look carefully
 to line up the USB connectors each time you want to plug this phone in.Neither
 of the Galaxy S5's two headlining hardware features is very evident. 
The heart rate sensor sits in the same housing as the camera's flash, 
right below the lens on the rear panel. If you didn't know what to look 
for, you wouldn't know it's there. The fingerprint reader is integrated 
into the Home button and is completely invisible - there is absolutely 
no sign that something has changed, compared to the S4, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.The only 
really visible change is the move to a water resistant enclosure, which 
necessitates a flap over the USB port. If you pop off the rear cover, 
you'll also note a rubber ring surrounding the battery and card slots. 
In addition to a ring of tiny clasps around the edges, the S5's rear 
cover also has clasps in the middle to ensure the rubber forms a seal 
around the sensitive components.One less noticeable change is 
that Samsung has finally ditched the Android Menu button, replacing it 
with a Recents button for multitasking. This makes a lot of sense, since
 all options are now available on screen and you don't have to dig for 
them. Long-pressing the Home button now pulls up Google Now, but Samsung
 still treats the Recents button as a Menu button sometimes. 
Long-pressing it when a home screen is visible still brings up options 
for customising it, which makes no sense.The S5 is 
slightly wider and taller than the Galaxy S4, and also less curvy and organic, 
which feels like a step backwards. Some people will find it just a bit 
too large for comfort, but at least the weight is manageable since it's 
all plastic. SoftwareAs far as its hardware design goes, 
the Galaxy S5 is not exciting at all, so we're interested in seeing how 
the software side fares. Samsung has spent a lot of time on its OS 
customisations, but there are still good and bad sides to its approach. 
The Galaxy S4 was widely criticised for its excesses, and so this time, 
Samsung has toned it down quite a bit. Even though there's still a lot 
to see, it's better organised and lots of things are tucked away. 
Surprisingly, the TouchWiz skin doesn't feel all that intrusive now.For
 example, the notification shade has only a few shortcuts visible by 
default, but tap a button in the corner (or pull down with two fingers 
instead of one) and you'll see no fewer than 21 shortcut and quick 
toggle buttons for things like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Power Saving Mode (and 
the separate Ultra Power Saving Mode), NFC, Smart Stay, Screen Rotation,
 and Private Mode. The home screens are thankfully quite simple, 
though you can have up to seven of them. Samsung has restricted itself 
to five small widgets and four icons. The Flipboard-style My Magazine 
view lives to the left of the first home screen, and as usual you can 
customise it to show news and social updates from your preferred 
sources.Amongst TouchWiz's little tricks are the Toolbox, a 
little floating panel that can stay on top of all apps and unroll to 
show quick shortcuts to up to five apps, and Multi Window, which lets 
you run two apps simultaneously. Quick Connect is somewhat like Apple's 
AirDrop, in that it lets you share content with other devices, except 
that it works with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Smart Stay and Smart Pause track 
your eye movements in order to keep the screen active as long as you're 
reading something, and pause a video when you look away.There's a
 power saving mode, which blocks background data connections and reduces
 performance. There's also Ultra Power Saving mode, which transforms the
 S5 into a barely-functional feature phone. All graphics and effects are
 turned off, and the screen itself switches to greyscale. The regular 
lock screen, home screens and menus disappear, replaced by a single 
monochrome screen with a very prominent pair of icons showing the 
battery percentage and standby time remaining. You can only make and 
receive calls and text messages, type notes and record audio. Data is 
enabled only when you use the browser, Google+ or Samsung's own ChatON 
messenger. No other apps are available, and you can only access a few 
basic settings. Even the screen timeout becomes more aggressive. Our
 test device promised over a week of standby time with a 65 percent 
charge in Ultra Power Saving Mode, which is very impressive. This could 
be a lifesaver on long journeys, or when you realise you won't have 
access to a charger for a long time.The Galaxy Gifts scheme 
offers buyers of this phone several hundred dollars' worth of freebies, 
such as subscriptions to Bloomberg Businessweek and the Wall Street 
Journal, upgraded cloud storage from Box and Bitcasa, and premium 
versions of RunKeeper, Evernote and LinkedIn.There's a Private 
Mode which lets you hide specific photos, videos, audio recordings, 
music tracks and files within their respective apps. When you turn it 
on, you'll be asked to swipe your finger or type your passcode again, 
and when you turn it off, selected content will disappear from within 
apps. You can't hide apps themselves, or content within third-party 
apps.Kids' Mode is a way to let young children play specific 
games on your phone while all other apps are locked down and safe from 
accidental (or non-accidental) taps. Blocking Mode is somewhat 
like a "Do Not Disturb" feature. You can choose to have all 
notifications disabled, including all calls or alternatively, only calls
 from numbers not already in your address book. It can be activated 
between set times each day, or even all the time.Samsung has 
always tweaked the Android Settings app, but now it looks completely 
new. By default, you see a grid of brightly coloured circular icons 
rather than the usual list. Thankfully you can switch back to the list 
or choose a tabbed view, because there are no fewer than 61 icons in the
 grid! The first 12 are "quick settings" for often-used functions, and 
are duplicated in their respective categories below. That's still a 
bewildering number of places to look for simple options, and it's highly
 likely that a lot of features will go undiscovered and unused because 
they're buried in here.Also, in fine Samsung tradition, there are
 apps which duplicate nearly every default Google app. There's the stock
 Android browser as well as Chrome; Gallery and Photos; Hangouts and 
ChatON, Play Music and Music; Email and Gmail; and even Samsung Apps 
alongside Google Play. Even worse, there are two voice assistants. A 
long-press on the Home button brings up Google now, but a quick 
double-tap brings up S-Voice. You can't delete most preloaded apps, but 
you can at least hide them from the app menu.We've heard rumours
 that Samsung is planning to ditch Android and is thus beginning to 
familiarise users with its own apps and aesthetic. Whether or not this 
eventually comes to pass, we wish the company would choose one path or 
another, since this approach wastes space and makes life difficult for 
new users. Nearly every action requires you to choose an app to work 
with. SpecificationsThere isn't really much to say about 
the Galaxy S5's hardware, except that it's all slightly better than the 
Galaxy S4's. The screen is mostly the same, at 1080x1920 pixels, but now
 has a wider range of brightness settings for different conditions. The
 processor is an Exynos 5420, with four ARM Cortex A15 cores running at 
up to 1.9GHz alongside four A7 cores running at up to 1.3GHz. Unlike 
earlier octa-core implementations which could use either or the two 
quad-core clusters at a time, any or all of the Exynos 5420's eight 
cores can run at the same time, and the phone's software and hardware 
are designed to recognise and address all of them individually.International
 LTE versions of the S5 will come with Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 
processors rather than the Exynos. It isn't clear exactly how the 
variants will differ in performance, and if we're getting shortchanged until we get our hands on both variants, but some reports have suggested the Exynos variant beats the Snapdragon at least in synthetic benchmarks.There's 2GB of RAM and 16GB of built-in storage. You can add
 a microSD card - Samsung's own documentation varies between 64GB and 
128GB as the highest capacity supported. Everything else is equally 
top-of-the-line: Wi-Fi ac, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC, USB 3.0, and a 2,800mAh 
battery.The camera can take 16-megapixel stills and 2160p 4K 
video. Samsung touts a number of camera improvements, such as quick 
hybrid autofocus (contrast and phase detection). Heart rate and fingerprint sensorsThe
 two headlining features deserve their own discussion. Both seem 
reactionary: one a response to a feature Apple has already launched; the
 other a pre-emptive move. 
However, only one is actually useful.The fingerprint sensor is 
beautifully hidden in the Home button. The S5 doesn't prompt you to set 
it up, so unless you dig into the Settings app, you really wouldn't have
 any way of knowing it's even there. You can enrol up to three 
fingerprints, which is too few for our liking, and unlock the phone by 
pressing the Home button and swiping down.Unlike Apple's 
one-touch implementation, you have to swipe across the button. A clever 
overlay on the screen shows you where you should place your fingertip so
 the entire digit can be scanned when you swipe. In casual usage, the 
sensor was accurate enough, with zero false positives and almost no 
failed detections. The fingerprint sensor can also be used to enter 
Private Mode, and Samsung has already opened it up to third parties 
including PayPal. Maybe Apple's caution over allowing others to 
use fingerprint authentication is a good thing, since it has already 
been demonstrated that Samsung's sensor can be fooled by the same moulds
 that tripped up Apple's. It's unlikely that anyone would go to such 
lengths to steal a single fingerprint, but if your data is extremely 
sensitive, you'll want to give the S5's fingerprint sensor a miss.On
 the other hand, the heart rate sensor is a complete oddity. You're 
meant to hold your index finger over the sensor, which isn't difficult 
thanks to the slightly raised camera above it, while the S-Health app 
reads your heart rate. The first problem with this is that it hardly 
ever worked - we were often frustrated by the S5's point blank refusal 
to register a reading even after jabbing the sensor and shifting our 
finger around several times. The few times that we did get a reading, 
results seemed to vary beyond wildly.The second issue is that 
it's highly disruptive to enter the app, select the heart rate module, 
and then wait for the sensor to register a reading. It hardly seems 
necessary to monitor heart rate in the first place, but maybe we'd do it
 if the process was seamless. As it is, we can't even be certain that 
the reading is accurate, so we're much less likely to ever bother with 
this feature again.This factor also applies to most of the 
S-Health app's other features, which include diet tracking and 
monitoring physical activity. We're sure they work better with Samsung's
 Gear series of wearable accessories, and we'll have a detailed review 
of that experience soon.CameraSamsung knows that a 
fantastic camera is totally necessary for to high-end smartphone, and 
the S5 does not disappoint. The app's interface is remarkably clean, but
 of course Samsung had to go and stick 24 settings icons in a menu. You 
can pin up to three of these to the main screen - by default only HDR 
and Selective Focus are pinned, and you have to dig into the menu even 
to turn the flash on or off.(Click to see full size)Photos taken with the Galaxy S5 are 
truly impressive. The level of detail and clarity is amazing, especially
 in close-up shots. When viewed at full size on a big screen, photos do 
seem a bit overprocessed, with a lot of compression going on. 
Thankfully, the 16-megapixel resolution is enough to mask that effect 
when photos are scaled down.The S5 performs impressively in 
nearly all light conditions. 4K video is stunningly clear, though you 
should be prepared for enormous file sizes. HDR works well, but 
surprisingly, the non-HDR versions of photo aren't saved. The selective 
focus trick, which is an artificial depth of field effect, doesn't 
always work - even when you can see a neat composition on screen, you'll
 often get an error message after pressing the shutter release.(Click to see full size)PerformanceThe
 Samsung Galaxy S5 is a flagship phone, and as such, there's no lack of 
performance. The CPU benchmark scores were particularly impressive, with
 37,114 in AnTuTu and 23,275 overall in Quadrant. Graphics scores 
brought down the average a little; we saw 26.8fps in GFXbench, and 6,693
 points in 3DMark's Ice Storm Extreme run-through. By comparison,
 the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact, powered by a Snapdragon 800, gave us 
slightly lower CPU-bound scores but considerably higher graphics scores,
 most likely because it has to do less work to fill up a 720p screen.Call
 quality was pretty good, and we had nothing to complain about in that 
department. In our video playback test, the battery lasted a very 
impressive 707 minutes, which is just shy of 12 hours. The Galaxy S5 
also managed to play pretty much every audio and video clip we threw at 
it without a hitch.

always work - even when you can see a neat composition on screen, you'll
 often get an error message after pressing the shutter release.

PerformanceThe
 Samsung Galaxy S5 is a flagship phone, and as such, there's no lack of 
performance. The CPU benchmark scores were particularly impressive, with
 37,114 in AnTuTu and 23,275 overall in Quadrant. Graphics scores 
brought down the average a little; we saw 26.8fps in GFXbench, and 6,693
 points in 3DMark's Ice Storm Extreme run-through. 

By comparison,
 the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact, powered by a Snapdragon 800, gave us 
slightly lower CPU-bound scores but considerably higher graphics scores,
 most likely because it has to do less work to fill up a 720p screen.

Call
 quality was pretty good, and we had nothing to complain about in that 
department. In our video playback test, the battery lasted a very 
impressive 707 minutes, which is just shy of 12 hours. The Galaxy S5 
also managed to play pretty much every audio and video clip we threw at 
it without a hitch.
