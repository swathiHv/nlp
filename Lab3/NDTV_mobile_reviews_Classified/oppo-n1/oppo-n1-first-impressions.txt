Oppo N1: First impressions

Oppo on Thursday made its debut in the Indian smartphone market with its
 flagship offering, the Oppo N1, priced at Rs. 39,999. We had a chance 
to get our hands on the device at the launch event in New Delhi, and 
these are the impressions we have of the phone. The Oppo N1 stands 
out because of its swiveling 13-megapixel rear camera, which can be used
 facing either the rear or the front. Obviously, this was the first 
thing we took a good look at. Our initial impression of the camera is 
that it is decent with HDR enabled, but only average without it. We'll 
have a more detailed report when we perform our standard test routine on
 it once it reaches our lab. This isn't the first time a rotating camera
 has been seen in India; the Gionee Elife E7 mini had a similar design. 
We're most interested in seeing whether the camera mechanism will hold 
up over time, or whether it will become loose with repeated use. The
 Oppo N1 has a 5.9-inch full HD IPS screen, which looked pretty 
impressive in the time we spent with it, in terms of resolution, viewing
 angles, brightness, and colour reproduction. The phone also feels solid
 and premium, thanks to its unibody construction. Oppo has done good 
work here with the design. The power/lock key and volume rocker are 
seamlessly integrated on the right side within the design flow and there
 is nothing on the left side of the device. Oppo has been in the 
news of late because of a version of the N1 that comes with CynogenMod 
preinstalled, but unfortunately the version coming to India will have 
Oppo's custom ColorOS UI on top of Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. The UI is 
based on gestures, something that will take time to become familiar 
with. At first, it did feel a bit like Gionee's Amigo UI, so we will 
examine the differences once we spend some more time with this device. Interestingly,
 the company has tweeted, "Oppo will be selling a limited edition of 
their latest flagship device, the OPPO N1, which will ship with 
CyanogenMod."The N1's back has a matte finish, and there's a 12 
cm2 touch panel in the middle, which Oppo calls O-Touch. What this panel
 does is make one-handed use a little more comfortable. You can scroll, 
tap, or take photos by touching it in the right places. We hope there's a
 way to turn it off as well. There is also an accessory device 
called O-click, which needs to be mentioned here. Oppo has stressed that
 this is a new invention. We weren't able to use it, but according to 
Oppo, it can be paired to your N1 using Bluetooth and then used to take 
pictures remotely. The O-click fits on your keychain and works at up to 
15 meters away, or so the company claims. Additionally it can help you 
find your phone if it is connected and within range.Overall, our 
first impressions of the Oppo N1 are positive. We are looking forward to
 reviewing the device and will soon examine it in great detail. The 
device certainly feels premium but is it worth spending Rs. 39,999 on? 
We'll find out soon, once it comes in for review. Oppo N1 in pictures
