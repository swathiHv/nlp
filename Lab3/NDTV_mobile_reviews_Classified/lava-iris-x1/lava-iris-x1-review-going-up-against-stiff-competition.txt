Lava Iris X1 Review: Going Up Against Stiff Competition 

Trying
 to slide its way into the pack of extraordinary budget smartphones that
 have been hitting the market of late is the Lava Iris X1. It runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat but its hardware specs look outdated when 
compared to the competition. One factor that might work in favour of the
 Iris X1 is that it looks quite similar to its elder brothers, the Lava Iris
 Pro 20 and Lava Iris Pro 30, which in turn are similar to the venerable iPhone 4 and 4S.The Lava Iris X1 has a lot of work to do in order gain some kind of foothold in this highly competitive segment. Look and feelAs we mentioned, the Lava Iris X1 looks deceptively similar to the iPhone 
4S and there is no denying that. It is not a bad design, but we were aware of how awkward it would have been if people had seen it and thought we were using a cheap iPhone knockoff.  The
 small body of the phone makes it easy to use with one hand but the smooth metal sides made it slip from our hands quite often. The phone is adequately slim at 9mm and weighs
 a comfortable 138g. We got the white variant for review, which doesn't look so good because of the black spots above the LCD needed for the sensors, earpiece and 
front-facing camera. They look 
like ugly cut-outs on the white body. A 4.5-inch screen takes up most of
 the front. The 
capacitive buttons for navigation are below the screen. They only light up when touched and are otherwise invisible. Annoyingly, it is very difficult
 to get a feel of where those buttons are, and more often than not we 
ended up fumbling to locate them.  A metal trim runs along the sides. While the phone is made of plastic, this kind of metal reinforcement is great for a phone in this price range. 
On the left edge is the volume rocker and on the right is the 
power button. The rear cover can be popped off easily. Under it is 
the compartment that houses the battery, a microSD card slot and two 
SIM card slots - one micro and one mini.  Specifications and softwareOn
 paper, the specifications are not too great. The phone has a Broadcom 
BCM2355 quad-core processor clocked at 1.2GHz with a Videocore IV GPU. 
There is also 1 GB of RAM. We will check whether these specifications will suffice in
 the performance section of the review. This phone was initially launched with 4GB of storage but Lava has changed that to 8GB post launch - buyers should make sure they get an 8GB model because the price is unchanged. Users 
can also expand it by up to 32GB using a microSD card. The phone has an 
8-megapixel primary camera with dual-LED flash for low-light situations.
 There is also a 2-megapixel front-facing camera. The two SIM cards can 
connect to the 850, 900, 1800, 1900 and 2100MHz frequency bands which includes Indian 3G networks. Additionally, there is support for Wi-Fi 
and Bluetooth (version 4.0) connectivity as well. The 4.5-inch screen has a resolution of 480x854. The screen is oversaturated
 but not so much that it will make you cringe. The viewing angles are good
 too. However, the screen gets washed out under bright sunlight. True
 to Lava's tradition, the company doesn't play around with the stock Android
 KitKat launcher on the Iris X1. The user is served is an
 unadulterated version of Android, which in our opinion is the best way to 
experience it. The only two apps that Lava bundles as third-party 
additions are OfficeSuite and File Manager, both of which are useful CameraThe 8-megapixel camera 
unit inside the Lava Iris X1 is a bit of a letdown. We had higher expectations considering Lava phones usually have decent cameras.  We 
had a tough time trying to focus on the subjects we wanted to. In our testing process, seeing shots come out unfocused was a recurring theme. When we
 did manage to focus on subjects in bright daylight, the images 
lacked detail and there was purple fringing was clearly evident. 
Moreover, the camera blows out highlights completely, and the 
exposure on such shots is completely off. The camera app is completely barebones; stripped of many features. Also, there is no HDR mode. The
 quality of captured video is very bad. We don't see anyone using it to 
even post 6-second videos on Vine. The 2-megapixel front camera smudges all details to create an image that looks artificial. This will 
be noticed by untrained eyes as well. Anyway, we didn't expect 
too much from the camera on a phone that costs just about Rs. 8,000. (click for full size)PerformanceThe
 Lava Iris X1 is sluggish in daily use and there were plenty of lags when opening apps or doing something as simple as scrolling through the app 
drawer. We also encountered times when apps would freeze completely and 
only force-closing them worked. The benchmark numbers also testify to the poor performance of the phone. it scored 12,112 and 3,440 respectively in AnTuTu and Quadrant, which is 
very low. The 3DMark Ice Storm benchmark failed to work despite 
repeated attempts. The Lava Iris X1 managed to log a paltry 6.7fps in 
the GFXbench test.We put the phone through our regular video 
playback tests and it failed to play even 720p (HD) videos without 
stuttering or skipping frames. The loudspeaker outputs tinny sound which crackles badly at high volumes.
 The bundled headset doesn't sound too great and we'd advise users to 
pick up a replacement. Call quality is decent but in our battery test, the phone managed to last 7 hours and 48 minutes, 
which is good for a day's worth of heavy usage. VerdictThe
 Lava Iris X1 is priced at around Rs. 7,999 and we are disappointed with its performance. With the arrival of Android One phones and the existence of older but better products such as the Moto E (Review | Pictures), Asus Zenfone 4 (Review | Pictures) and Xiaomi Redmi 1S (Review | Pictures), the Iris X1
 fails on many counts. Most of these phones are also significantly less expensive than the Lava Iris X1 which makes it a very unattractive proposition.Â
