Xolo Q2100 Review: Not Just a One-trick Pony

Xolo is one example of an Indian company that has managed to stay ahead of the curve by
 constantly innovating in the mid-range smartphone segment. We give it credit for its efforts, but there is still a long way 
to go if it wants to create one smartphone that can redefine the entire market. Xolo's Hive 
UI and the first phone to use it, the 8X-1000 (Review | Pictures) were good efforts but lacked finesse. The recently 
launched Xolo Q2100 takes a different approach, with a fingerprint scanner and an IR blaster; 
features normally found in high-end smartphones. Let's find out if Xolo has gotten it right. Look and feelAs we stated in our first impressions of the device, the Xolo Q2100 
doesn't look as attractive as other phones from Xolo's stable, but it 
does feels sturdy. We initially thought the rear cover was not 
removable, but it is. The phone has a two-tone finish with a black front and white
 rear. The rear panel is a dirt magnet, though. Two parallel 
chrome lines run around the edges of the Xolo Q2100. The power button and
 the volume rocker are on the right edge of the device. They are made of
 metal and the travel is good. The Micro-USB port and the microphone
 lie at the bottom, and the 3.5mm jack and IR blaster
 are on the top of the phone. Xolo has decided to go with capacitive buttons for navigation, which lie below the 
display.  The rear of the phone has the primary camera with 
flash, the loudspeaker and most importantly the fingerprint scanner. Specifications and SoftwareThe
 innards of the Xolo Q2100 include a Mediatek MT6582 quad-core 
processor clocked at 1.3GHz with an integrated Mali-400MP2 GPU. There is 1GB of RAM 
for running applications and services. The internal storage 
space of 8GB can be expanded by 32GB using a microSD card.There
 are two SIM card slots, and the phone supports the 850/900/1800/1900/2100MHz 
GSM bands. Rounding up the connectivity options are Wi-Fi and 
Bluetooth. The primary camera can capture 8-megapixel images and has a 
Sony Exmor R sensor. There is also a 2-megapixel front camera.The 5.5-inch screen has a resolution of 720x1280, which 
translates to a pixel density of 267ppi. It has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 
protection as well. The colours are slightly 
oversaturated on this display but the sharpness is pretty good. When 
viewed at an angle, the colours on screen start distorting. However, the
 sunlight legibility of the phone is pretty decent.Unlike the 
Xolo 8X-1000 which features Hive UI - the company's first attempt to 
create a unique skin slapped on top of Android - the Q2100 has 
stock Android 4.4.2. Apart from a few tweaks, this
 phone provides a pure Android experience. The very first thing 
that one notices is the addition of the fingerprint scanner that can be 
used to unlock the device, as popularised by the iPhone 5s. The implementation
 is however different than that of the iPhone or the Samsung Galaxy S5 (Review | Pictures),
 where the scanner is below the screen. On the Xolo Q2100 the 
scanner is on the rear of the device, similar to what we saw in the HTC 
One Max (Review), just below the camera. After extended 
usage, we have confirmed our first impressions of the fingerprint scanner, which you 
can read here. In short, it works about 80 percent of the time and 
offers helpful messages like "Finger was offset to the left of the 
sensor" in case of a failed attempt. We did notice that the 
sensor did not work if the battery level was below 10 percent. It is also important to swipe with the entire pad of your finger while setting up the sensor, not just the tip. The 
fingerprint scanner might be the most visible feature of this phone, but Xolo actually hits the home run with this phone's IR emitter, combined with the Peel Smart Remote app. 
Peel Smart Remote acts as a universal remote control with virtually all TVs and set-top boxes. We tried the remote on Samsung and Videocon TVs, and it worked flawlessly. We tried it with DishTV and 
regular cable as well, which again worked without any errors. We 
could also set reminders for particular shows. 
After making a comeback in flagship smartphones in 2013, the inclusion 
of IR in mid-budget devices is 
indeed welcome. To make use of the real estate of the 
5.5-inch screen, Xolo also makes a few tweaks to the Settings app and 
adds something called 'Float Multitask Window'. The main categories inside
 the Settings app are arranged as icons on the left while individual settings are 
on the right. The 'Float Multitask Window' is a small dot that sticks
 to the edge of the screen, which when touched, turns into a wheel 
filled with options. One of these is Game Mode, in which the home button 
is disabled so that it can't be hit by mistake in the middle of a fast-paced game. Read Mode makes sure the screen never goes off. Float Music and Float Video open the respective apps as floating windows on screen. Additionally, Xolo also bundles 
LastPass, which is a great option for storing all your passwords in one 
secure location. One of the cool things about LastPass on
 this phone is that it allows users to use the fingerprint scanner to enter the password to any website or app. Just remember not to forget the app's master password! 
There are also Xolo-specific apps such as Xolo Care, Xolo Power and Xolo Secure.
 Xolo Care allows users to call, SMS or e-mail the company's support staff in case any problems crop
 up on the device. The Xolo Power app is good for users who 
are constantly worried about battery life. Xolo Secure
 is an application that can be used to secure your phone in case of theft.CameraThe camera 
app on the Xolo Q2100 is a mashup of the stock Gingerbread and KitKat apps. 
It is unintuitive with a circular menu that just feels awkward to use. 
Moreover, there aren't many manual options either. This is a simplistic 
app. (Click to see full size)We were surprised at how fast 
this camera functioned. It can lock focus on a subject really quickly and 
take photos in an instant. In daylight, the camera takes some decent 
images up close with good amount of details and close-to-natural 
colours. The only problem we noticed was that it blows out highlights
 in the background. Even the HDR mode couldn't do much to fix this. The 
same problem cropped up in the 1080p video clips we recorded. We liked the 
fact that the lens managed to remain steady while shooting video. In 
low-light conditions, the camera failed to capture good images. 
Sometimes the image was just a huge blurry mess and sometimes it was 
just too dark. The front-facing camera takes some decent pictures, 
though.  PerformanceThe Xolo Q2100 is rather 
smooth in day-to-day usage. We didn't notice any lags even when we 
opened multiple apps. High-end games like 
Asphalt 8 stuttered a bit but not enough to ruin the experience. The 
graphics were toned down in our testing process. The phone scored 17,504 points in AnTuTu, whereas it 
got 6,777 overall in Quadrant. For some reason, despite repeated attempts, the GFXbench 
test failed to work but in the 3DMark Ice Storm test the phone scored 
3,145, which is pretty low. All our test videos played fine, including 
our heavily encoded 40mbps 1080p clip. The Xolo 
Q2100 has DTS surround sound technology built in and the speaker is
 extremely loud. It is clear enough for watching a movie in a closed room, 
negating the need to spend on Bluetooth 
speakers. The bundled earphones are pretty decent too.  We didn't notice any loss in sound quality even during phone calls. In our 
battery test, the phone managed to last exactly 7 hours and 30 
minutes before it died. This means that it should last at least a
 day with moderate usage. VerdictXolo's attempt to bring 
features normally found in flagship phones to a phone that costs Rs. 
13,499 is commendable. Both the fingerprint scanner and the IR 
blaster work really well, for the most part, and aren't just gimmicks. At least during our testing period, we got pretty accustomed 
to using these features. This is also a good device for someone who wants a phone with a large screen to watch videos on. Our only gripes with the device are the boring design 
and the subpar camera quality. The Moto G (Gen 2) (Review | Pictures) is a great 
phone if stock Android is what you seek. Buyers can also take a
 look at the Micromax Canvas Nitro (Review | Pictures) and Xolo's own Xolo 8X-1000 in 
the same price range.
