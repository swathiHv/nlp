Nokia Asha 501 review

he Nokia Lumia range might be making headlines, but Nokia's feature 
phones including its relatively new Asha series phones are the ones 
making cash registers ring for the company across India. The latest to 
join the bandwagon is the Asha 501, which was unveiled a few months back
 by Nokia chief Stephen Elop at an event in India. Nokia has 
been known to come out with solid, sturdy devices rather than flashy, glitzy 
ones when it comes to its budget phones. However, we think that the 
Nokia Asha 501 is here to change that and reveals the brand's playful 
side in the feature phone segment. The much hyped Nokia Asha 501 has 
finally made it to the Indian market. But does it live up to 
expectations? We take a close look.Build/ DesignAt a time 
when phones seem to be getting bigger, the Nokia Asha 501 goes the 
opposite direction, opting for a compact build with dimensions of 
99.2x58x12.1mm. When we got the device in our hands the first time, the word that came to our mind was 'cute'. The Asha 501 easily reminded
 us of the Lumia smartphones and though it is a bit chunky, thanks to 
its design, it fits in one hand easily. It is pretty light in weight at 
just 91 grams.Be it an entry-level feature phone or a Lumia 
smartphone, the one thing that remains consistent in a Nokia phone is 
its style and design, which generally exudes quality and matches 
international design standards. The Nokia Asha 501 lives up to this 
legacy. The front panel is dominated by a 3-inch display that is 
surrounded by a black bezel with a physical 'Back' key placed at the 
bottom of the panel and the Nokia logo on top of the screen just below 
the earpiece. Nokia has followed the same Lumia design language, placing
 the physical keys for volume controls and power buttons on the right. 
We did miss a camera hardware key, though. The top panel houses a 2.5mm 
charging port, a Micro-USB port and a 3.5mm audio port.The back 
of the device includes a 3.2-megapixel camera placed at the centre 
towards the top, with a vertical Nokia branding just below the camera. 
At the bottom of the rear panel, there's a button that can be pressed to remove the back panel. This sounds simple, though it took some time to get
 used to. The back panel is an exchangeable shell which can be 
replaced with other bright coloured panels that include Red, Cyan 
Yellow, Green, White and Black colours. The battery is removable and a Micro-SIM card slot hides behind it in the same compartment. The second Micro-SIM can be changed without switching off the device and same is 
the case with the memory card. Overall, the Nokia Asha 501 is 
impressive in design and, definitely a looker. The handset, despite its 
relatively low price, feels solid and is comfortable to use. DisplayThe
 Nokia Asha 501 includes a 3-inch capacitive display, a huge advantage 
for a device in the price segment. The 3-inch TFT capacitive display 
comes with a resolution of 240x320 pixels and boasts a pixel density of 
133PPI. It includes options like brightness control, RGB Stripe,
 and support for the double tap to wake up gesture. The display 
is responsive to touch, though at times it has a bit of a lag. It supports
 two-point touch and includes a 
proximity sensor. The display has good viewing angles and is readable 
under the sun.Software/ InterfaceWith the Asha 501,
 Nokia has introduced a new platform, which it calls the Nokia Asha 
software platform 1.0 instead of S40 (Series 40) which powers other Asha 
devices. However, the user-interface is similar to that of the S40 
operating system found in previous versions of the Asha series of touch 
phones, based on the Nokia N9's swipe concept. Nokia Asha 501 comes with a UI that is easy to use and largely dominated by gesture controls 
like swiping. The Back 
hardware key proves to be handy when stuck 
in app or for closing an app.Nokia unveiled the Fastlane feature 
for the Asha 501. It collectively shows all the recent apps in a list 
form according to dates. The feature gives a quick overview yout activity. For instance, if you played a game or used an app on the
 device it will automatically be featured on the Fastlane as a log. It 
is also the default homescreen when one unlocks the phone, and doubles up as a task-switcher of sorts. Swiping the 
screen from either side, from any app or game takes you directly to the 
Fastlane. While using an app, you can access options by swiping up from 
the bottom and these appear. It worked well for us. If you want 
to change the location of an app or even delete it, just long press and 
hold the app icon on the menu list. There are not many personalisation 
options on the Asha 501, which is a bit of a let down and one can only 
change the wallpaper and sound profiles. The phone comes with the 
default standby screen with a digital clock, and you can change it in 
the Settings through the 'Glance screen' option. There is a notification
 bar at the top, similar to what we have already seen in previous Asha 
phones. You can pull it down to see SIM information and adjust Wi-Fi, 
Bluetooth, mobile data and sound profile settings.The Nokia Asha 
501 comes with the company's proprietary Xpress Browser, which was 
introduced for the Asha range of phones. The browser compresses the 
data, much like the Opera Mini. We had no complaints browsing the web on
 the phone. One can open up to 6 web pages on the device at once and can
 switch between them. The phone comes with some preloaded apps 
and games. The games are Java-based but the experience was great for a phone at this price point. Some popular apps that come 
pre-installed include Facebook, Twitter, Nokia Chat, twist Music and 
NewsHunt. The Asha 501 comes with 40 free EA games that can be 
downloaded using Wi-Fi. WhatsApp is said to be available on the platform shortly. One 
can browse and download apps through the Store. We downloaded the Here 
Maps Beta version on our Asha 501 and it worked well with Wi-Fi.CameraThe
 Nokia Asha 501 comes with a 3.2-megapixel camera without flash and 
auto-focus options. The camera comes with some basic features and offers
 toggles for timer settings, white balance, effects and photo resolution
 adjustment. The resolution can be changed to 2048x1536, 1600x1200, 
1280x960 and 640x480. The camera can take decent shots in 
daylight with good colours but lacks details, and we found that night 
shots were not that great. Same was the case with indoor photos which were rather grainy. The Nokia Asha 501 is not a device 
to click close-up shots because of the camera's fixed-focus nature. The camera comes with digital zoom up to 3X.The
 pictures miss out on detail but considering the price and the audience 
that Nokia is targeting, we can say it doesn't disappoint completely.PerformanceThe
 Nokia Asha 501 handled swiping well and was smooth and responsive for 
most part. Some apps did freeze at times, but we were able to exit to the 
home screen through the back key. The phone offered good call clarity 
with both the SIM slots and the FM radio reception was decent. The phone
 can be unlocked either by using the power key or by double-tapping the 
screen, which is a cool feature.Sadly the music player of the 
Asha 501 misses out on basic options like adjustable equalisers and 
pre-set music profiles. The music player interface does show the artwork
 related to the song and the album. The speaker was good and loud.We
 had no complaints watching some of our favourite videos on the device 
through YouTube, though the video playing experience was limited with no support for MP4, MOV, MKV or AVI file formats. It was unable to play 720p (or higher) video either.We would 
have loved if Nokia included a notification light as it would have enhanced the overall experience of using the handset.The Gallery app supports pinch to zoom and gives options to share images 
through Bluetooth and email. The pinch to zoom feature worked well 
during our time with the phone.The Nokia Asha 501 comes with 
128MB of internal storage and 64MB of RAM. It also supports expandable 
memory cards up to 32GB thanks to microSD card slot. Connectivity 
features include like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Micro-USB. However, we did 
miss 3G on the device. The device packs a 1200mAh battery that 
the company claims, delivers 624 hours of standby time and a talk time of
 17 hours. However, we were not very happy with the back-up. When
 we used the device (with Wi-Fi) for Web browsing, chatting, 
playing games like Litle Big City, Bubble Bash, Wolverine and others, we
 found that the battery just about lasted a day, which is less than what you expect from phones in this category.However, when not using Wi-Fi or data on the phone and 
using it for just normal calling, messaging, occasionally clicking 
photos and playing some games, the device lasted a couple of days with 
just one full charge.Verdict The Nokia Asha 501 is 
definitely good in some departments but disappoints in some. If we 
consider the price of the device and the features that it brings, it is overall a very good deal. For those looking to buy a feature 
phone that delivers a smartphone-like experience, the Nokia Asha 501 is a
 decent package. One thing that surprised us was that both the 
SIM slots supported Micro-SIM, which may be an inconvenience for some. Overall, the Asha 501 scores well in terms of design, 
user-interface and build quality.Those looking for alternatives 
can go for a Samsung's Galaxy Star that comes at a price of Rs. 4,900. 
Another Android option is the Micromax Bolt A35, which comes at a price 
of Rs. 4,400.If you want a Nokia alternative then you can also opt for Nokia Asha 305.Nokia Asha 501: In picturesPrice: Rs. 5,199
