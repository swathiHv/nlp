Asus ZenFone 5 Review: Setting the Benchmark for Budget Segment

Taiwan-based Asus has expanded its India footprint with the launch of 
the new ZenFone smartphone series which is comprised of three models, 
the ZenFone 4, ZenFone 5 and ZenFone 6, which were first unveiled at CES
 this year.The sub-Rs. 10,000 is dominated by popular domestic 
handset vendors such as Micromax, Karbonn, and Lava, but global brands 
including Samsung and Motorola are starting to pay attention to the 
entry-level segment too. The recently launched Micromax Unite 2 (Review | Pictures), Lava 
Iris X1 and Moto E (Review | Pictures) even run KitKat, the most recent version of Android.Asus
 has priced its ZenFone series aggressively, and both the ZenFone 4 and 
ZenFone 5 cost less than Rs. 10,000. The company has certainly created a
 buzz in the market with its low prices, but it remains to be seen 
whether this strategy will help set cash counters ringing.We 
received the ZenFone 5 ahead of its official launch date, and it definitely got our attention 
with its good looks. We put the ZenFone 5 to the test to see if it can 
take on the current top performers in the sub-Rs. 10,000 segment.Look and feelThe
 ZenFone 5 is a basic candybar phone with a basic yet modern style. It's
 just as well built as Asus' other popular products such as the hybrid 
tablet PadFone.The first thing you will notice about the ZenFone5
 is its boxy shape, which in a way gives it a high-end feel. In some 
ways, it reminded us of the original HTC One - minus the metal casing 
and dual front speakers.The handset feels solid and sturdy. 
It's 148.2mm tall and 72.8mm wide. Thanks to these generous proportions, 
the thickness of 10.34mm doesn't feel too bad. The ZenFone 5 is 
available in five colours in India: Charcoal Black, Pearl White, Cherry 
Red, Sky Blue, and Solar Yellow. We got our hands on the Charcoal Black 
one and it looked very nice indeed.As we wrote in our first 
impressions of the Asus ZenFone 5, the phone's ergonomic design and good looks are
 its best features.The smartphone was easy to hold and use with a
 single hand, at least for us. It was easy to reach most of the screen 
with just the thumb; people with smaller hands might face some issues. The
 ZenFone 5's front is dominated by its 5-inch display with the section 
below it sporting a concentric circle finish which matches the design of
 Asus' ZenBook laptops. The 2-megapixel front-facing
 camera, a notification LED and the sensor array are located above the 
screen.The metallic-looking volume and power buttons are all in a
 line on the device's right edge and we had no problem hitting them. The 
audio jack is placed on top, and the Micro-USB port is on the bottom. The
 rear is noticeably curved and features a soft-touch material allowing 
the phone to sit comfortably in hand. This might look good, but it 
actually means the camera lens is flush with the rear surface, which 
means it could get scratched when the phone is left in a bag or on a 
table. A simple plastic cover would fix this.The 8-megapixel 
camera and LED flash are centred on the rear panel with subtle Zenfone and 
Intel Inside branding below. The panel pops off to reveal the two  SIM 
slots, non-removable battery, and a microSD card slot.Features, specifications and softwareConfirming
 the ZenFone 5's place within the budget segment is a dual-core 1.6GHz 
Intel Atom Z2560 processor with what Intel calls Hyper-Threading 
technology, which allows each core to execute two instructions at a 
time.Asus also demonstrated another version of the Zenfone 5 at 
this year's Computex show dubbed ZenFone 5 LTE, with a 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor for integrated LTE 
support. This version might be ready for launch by the end of the year, 
so for now only the non-LTE 3G version is available.The ZenFone 5
 comes with 2GB of RAM and will be sold with either 8GB or 16GB of 
internal storage plus support for up to 64GB microSD cards. Connectivity
 includes Wi-Fi b/g/n, GPS, and Bluetooth.This is a dual-SIM 
device (GSM+GSM) and supports two Micro-SIMs, both with 3G connectivity 
though only one 3G connection can be active at a time. There is a 
2,110mAh battery which is pretty good for a handset in this segment.The
 Zenfone 5 features a 5-inch IPS HD (720x1280-pixel) screen with Corning
 Gorilla Glass 3 for protection. The screen's 294ppi pixel density makes text sharp and 
clear, but is a letdown when compared to the likes of the Moto G (Review | Pictures) which boasts of 
329pixels per inch.Â (Also see: Asus Zenfone 5 vs. Motorola Moto G)The ZenFone 5's screen is highly reflective and gets
 washed out a bit in sunlight unless you really raise the brightness 
level. Thankfully, viewing angles were never a problem.The 
ZenFone 5 also comes with an app called Splendid that lets you control 
the colour temperature, saturation and hue of the display. There is a 
Reading mode for ebook lovers and Glove mode that increases touch 
sensitivity so you can use the device while wearing gloves.The 
Asus ZenFone 5 has three capacitive navigation buttons - Back, Home and 
Recents - below the screen, which is in contrast to the Moto G's virtual
 keys.The device runs Android 4.3 Jelly Bean with company's new 
ZenUI skin on top. However, Asus has promised that an update to Android 
4.4 KitKat is already on its to-do list. The company has been 
touting its ZenUI for some time now. Android users who have had a chance 
to use the stock OS, will find the arrangement of features on the 
ZenFone 5 a bit unsettling. Asus' skin applies to several elements of 
the UI such as the app icons, although the changes are not as radical as
 Gionee's Amigo UI or Samsung's TouchWiz UI.The
 Asus ZenUI allows you to customise onscreen elements, such as the 
colour theme and level of transparency. The company has customised 
nearly all stock apps on the handsets including the Gallery and Music 
apps, adding more functionality. The Gallery app shows a timeline of 
images and videos, as well as the ability to sync them to any cloud 
service including the company's own Asus Webstorage. The default music 
player offers option to tweak equalizer levels even during song 
playback.The ZenUI offers Chrome in addition to the default browser. The
 default browser does not support Adobe Flash. ZenFone 5's 
notifications tray by default offers shortcuts to frequently used settings 
including airplane mode, battery status, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, data 
usage, audio profiles, and brightness. You can reorder the shortcuts by 
just tapping the edit button in the notification tray.The phone 
comes with a number of apps such as What's Next, which can track and 
manage apps; Do It Later, a to-do list; Super Note, for taking notes; 
Zen Link (Share Link, Party Link, PC Link, and Remote Link apps); Asus 
WebStorage, the company's cloud storage app (all users get 5GB free for 
life), and Omlet Chat, a free instant messaging app.A Power Saver
 app offers users three options: an ultra-saving mode that disconnects 
the network connection when the device is asleep; optimised mode, which 
doesn't switch off data, and a custom mode which can be tweaked by the 
user.In addition to these, the ZenFone 5 includes Google Drive, 
Gmail, Hangouts, Google+, Google Search, Google Photos, the Play Store, 
Google Play Music (Books, Games, and Movie), and YouTube. The handset 
also comes preloaded with Amazon's Kindle appand the popular Candy 
Crush.Overall, Asus has tried to make its new ZenUI as rich as 
possible. While most users would not have a problem with this, fans of 
stock Android fans will be far from impressed.CameraThe 
ZenFone 5 sports an 8-megapixel autofocus rear camera with an f/2.0 
aperture lens and LED flash. There is also a 2-megapixel front camera. 
Asus also touts its ownPixelMaster technology which it claims combines 
software, hardware and optical design to deliver improved image quality.The
 default camera app offers a few tools, most notably Time Rewind, which 
starts buffering images and saves up to 31 images starting two seconds 
before you actually press the shutter button. The camera app 
offers 18 modes - there's Auto, HDR, 
Panorama, Night, Low-light, Selfie (detects faces within the frame 
automatically), Miniature, Depth of Field (background blur), Smart 
Remove (removes unwanted moving objects), All Smiles, Beautification 
(helps adjusting the subject's look in real-time), Time Rewind, and GIF 
animation (automatically converts a series of photos into a GIF). The
 ZenFone 5's camera app also offers settings for shutter, focus, 
brightness, image size, ISO, white balance, colour effects, timer, 
geo-tagging, shutter sound, and storage. Zoom can be adjusted by pinching
 in and out, and the volume buttons also double as shutter keys when 
you're in the app though there is an onscreen button as well.We 
tested the camera of the ZenFone 5 outdoors in well-lit conditions and 
indoors in sufficient light. The photos we got were crisp and had good 
amounts of detail. Low-light shots had far less detail though noise was 
well under control. It also does a good job with videos and supports 1080p
 video capture. The front 2-megapixel camera also takes decent pictures, and the Beautification mode helps. Overall,
 the Asus ZenFone 5 features an excellent camera for the price, but don't expect it to 
match the quality of more expensive phones, especially in low light.PerformanceIn
 terms of sheer speed, the ZenFone 5 is easily the best sub-Rs. 10,000 
Android phone we have used. There was no lag, and multiple apps 
including heavy games such as Asphalt 8 and Dead Trigger 2 were handled 
with ease.Heat from the rear panel was noticeable after long 
gaming sessions, though not alarming. The handset also did heat up a bit
 during prolonged data usage and calls. Voice was loud and clear, 
both in the earpiece and on speakerphone. On the multimedia front, the 
ZenFone 5 is a decent performer. The 5-inch HD screen is good for movies
 and videos. The ZenFone 5 was able to play full-HD videos and supported
 popular video formats including avi, mov, mkv, and mp4. The 
Asus ZenFone 5 handled graphics and gaming with ease. We achieved scores
 of 19,663 in AnTuTu, and 9,000 overall in Quadrant, which easily trumps
 the Moto G which scored 11,874 and 8,569 respectively. 3DMark's 720p Ice
 Storm Extreme scenario returned a score of 7638 points, while GFXBench 
managed to run at 17.3fps. Looking at these benchmark scores the Zenfone
 5 does not appear to be a budget device at all.The battery was 
able to able to last 6 hours and 40 minutes in our video loop test.We 
were able to get about 8-9 hours of Web browsing and phone calls with 
the usual notifications for messages, emails, Facebook, Twitter, BBM, 
and WhatsApp, alongside some casual photography, with the screen 
brightness turned all the way up and with 3G active the whole time. With
 more moderate usage, we were able to make it last 10-11 hours.VerdictPeople
 looking for a phone with a big screen can definitely consider the Asus 
ZenFone 5, which is priced at an amazingly low Rs. 9,999. Its features 
and performance give it an edge over most of the competition, not only 
in the sub-Rs. 10,000 segment but also against many higher-priced phones 
such as the Nokia Lumia 630 Dual SIM (Review | Pictures). The Zenfone 5 is the first device to
 truly offer competition to the Moto G. Thanks to its larger screen and 
support for expandable storage, it could easily become more popular than a longtime favourite. Asus ZenFone 5 in pictures
