Asus Fonepad 7 Dual SIM Review: A Blast From the Recent Past

The 7-inch tablet category has lately been seeing an influx of 
options with voice-calling capabilities. Buyers seem to be toying with 
the idea of screens bigger than phablets, even if such devices make them look 
ridiculous while making calls. We've seen
 quite a few people in the wild using Samsung Galaxy Tab 2s and 3s stuck to 
their faces. We are trying to recollect if we actually got to see their faces, 
though. Thankfully, others use wired/Bluetooth headsets for 
making calls. Asus is making the most of this trend by launching 
Fonepad variants left, right and centre. In a little more than a year, the 
Taiwanese technology major has launched three Fonepad tablets - all of 
them featuring SIM card support and voice calling. The latest one is the Fonepad 7 Dual SIM. Now, buyers can make phone calls on 
two networks instead of one. The updated Fonepad 7 Dual SIM has the 
same specs as its single-SIM sibling. Read our review to find 
out what's changed, and if the changes are good. Look and FeelThe
 Fonepad 7 Dual SIM has quite a few differences in the design department
 when compared to the Fonepad 7. It is slightly heavier, at 340g, and slightly wider and thicker too. The dual 
front-firing speakers have been replaced by a single speaker grille on the lower back of 
the device. The back features the same white plastic panel which is 
really glossy, reflective and attracts smudges easily. The camera is, 
however, not protruding this time. The bare front of the 
Asus Fonepad 7 makes way for an Asus logo below the screen on this 
device.  The right edge features the volume rocker and power button -
 both made of plastic. On the top, we have the Micro-USB port and 3.5mm headset jack. The plastic is slippery and we were forced to use two hands 
for operating it most of the time. Features and specificationsThe
 Fonepad 7 Dual SIM has a 1.2GHz dual-core Intel Atom Z2520 
dual-core processor under the hood. Apart from this it has 8GB of internal storage of which
 approximately 5GB is available for the users to install apps and copy 
content. We have to make a mention of the fact that unlike other companies, Asus specifies this explicitly on the back of the box. Furthermore, users
 can expand the storage up to 64GB by inserting a microSD card, and Asus 
also provides 16GB of cloud storage for a year on its own 
cloud platform. The 5-megapixel rear camera can shoot 
videos at 1080p, and for users who like taking selfies the Fonepad Dual 
SIM has a 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera which can capture videos at 
720p resolution. Both the SIMs can operate on the 850/900/1800/1900 bands. The 
device also has Bluetooth 4.0, a gyroscope and proximity sensor. The
 7-inch screen has a resolution of 1280x800 which is the same as
 both the Fonepad 7 and the original Fonepad. The screen is highly 
reflective and susceptible to smudges just like the back. Viewing 
angles are okay but legibility is not great under sunlight. On the 
whole, we actually liked the crispness of the screen despite its low density of 216 
ppi.SoftwareOne look at the software and we were 
immediately transported back to November 2013 when we reviewed the 
Fonepad 7. Despite running Android 4.3 as opposed to Android 4.2.2 on 
the Fonepad 7, the skin is exactly the same. The only difference is that some third-party apps have been been dropped, which is good.
 We love it when manufacturers reduce bloatware. Asus adds a
 fourth button to the standard three-button Android setup, which opens 
'floating apps'. Floating apps or widgets are nothing but apps that can 
be opened in a smaller window size to to allow multitasking across all the real estate that a 7-inch screen offers. Audiowizard is a 
barebones app that lets users choose from a set of modes 
which we presume are equaliser presets. Asus calls its screen enhancement tech Splendid, and there's an app of the same name that
 lets users tweak colour settings to their liking. The rest of the apps bundled with the Fonepad 7 Dual SIM are Amazon Kindle, Zinio and a few other Asus branded apps. CameraAsus
 has a proprietary camera app that allows users to change manual 
settings such as ISO, exposure value and white balance. It also has a 
severely limited set of four effects that one can apply. The 
5-megapixel camera on the Asus Fonepad 7 Dual SIM is a mixed bag. 
Focusing is slightly erratic but once focused, the camera manages to 
capture images really quickly. The details captured by the camera are great but 
the colour seems to be slightly off. The camera has a problem with the 
auto white balance feature. We suggest changing the white balance 
manually to suit conditions. If used with patience, the Fonepad 7 
Dual SIM can indeed capture some good images, especially close-ups. (click to view full size)The
quality of captured video is not that great despite the 1080p resolution. 
The front camera takes just about serviceable photographs. PerformanceThe
 Asus Fonepad 7 Dual SIM is one of the few Android tablets in the market to feature a 
hyper-threaded Intel processor under the hood. In day-to-day usage, the 
tablet performed really well and felt extremely snappy to use with nary a
 lag. We want to present a few numbers confirming the claims. The
 AnTuTu and Quadrant benchmarks returned scores of 15,127 and 5,940 
respectively, which are respectable results. The GFXbech test threw up a
 result of 9.9 fps which is neither good nor bad, and similarly, the 3DMark 
Ice Storm scenario had a final score of 4,994. The Fonepad 7 
played video files encoded at any resolution without any hiccups. 
Complementing this great video performance is the audio performance. We 
tested the audio playback on our reference earphones considering Asus 
doesn't bundle any in the box, and we found the sound quality to be 
really good. The only blot on the otherwise good scoresheet of the
 Asus Fonepad 7 Dual SIM is the average sounding speaker. This is a 
setback considering the front-firing speakers were really good on theolder model . In our battery tests, the tablet lasted us a good 9 hours, 23 minutes before we had to charge it. This bodes well for the
 battery life of the device and we expect it to last at least two full 
days with heavy usage. The call quality on the device is great too (yes, 
we used a wired headset for phone calls) with absolutely no problem in 
latching on to networks. VerdictSurprisingly, with a price of Rs.
 12,999, the Asus Fonepad 7 Dual SIM is in fact cheaper than its elder 
sibling. The increased girth notwithstanding, it has all the features 
that you would expect from a tablet in this price range - a good screen, great media playback, respectable battery life, lag-free performance 
and a decent camera too. We can't find much fault with the device and Asus 
seems to have hit the bullseye with this one. Other options 
available in this price range are the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, HP Slate 7, and Lenovo IdeaTab A3000. Asus Fonepad 7 Dual SIM in pictures
