Honor 6 Plus Review: A Photographer's Delight

After
 wowing quite a few critics with the Honor 6, Huawei's latest flagship, 
Honor 6 Plus, is making all the noise now. The Honor 6 Plus' most 
important feature is the trio of 8-megapixel cameras - two on the rear 
and a front-facing one. In its marketing spiel, Honor, a new sub-brand of Huawei, claims 
that the two parallel cameras on the rear can take better pictures than a
 DSLR camera. While we are taking those words with more than 
just a pinch of salt, we'd be very pleased if the Honor 6 Plus can take 
better photos than other Android smartphones in the same price range. 
Let's dive right in. Look and feelIf Huawei's last 
flagship, Honor 6 (Review | Pictures), looked like the love child of the Apple iPhone 4 and the 
Lava Iris Pro 30 (Review | Pictures), the Honor 6 Plus looks like a fusion of the iPhone 4 
and Sony Xperia Z3 (Review | Pictures). Taking cues from the iPhone 4's design, which had a 
glass back and metal edges, Huawei incorporates a similar design albeit 
on the much larger body of the Honor 6 Plus. A metal trim runs around the
 edges of the phone, and a sheet of glass is spread across the rear. In the same vein, the bottom of the phone has gentle curves 
that remind us of the Sony Xperia Z3. The Honor 6 Plus is fairly
 slim at 7.5mm but the weight of 165g is above average. However, 
we like the heft as it is distributed evenly across the body. Thanks to 
really slim bezels, holding the phone is not too difficult, although one-handed operation might take some effort. Despite being 
protected by Corning's Gorilla Glass 3 on the rear, the glass back is 
actually prone to scratches and could crack if the phone isn't handled 
with care. We'd recommend using a case with this phone. The volume rocker
 and power button reside on the right edge of the phone. The lack of a dedicated camera button on a phone 
that claims to take great images feels like a missed opportunity.  Below the power
 button are two trays, one for the Micro-SIM card and 
another one that can accept either a Nano-SIM card or a microSD card. We received an early import from China for review, which simply did not recognise any Nano-SIM we inserted. Honor representatives told us that the Honor 6 Plus is marketed in India as a single-SIM device and units sold here will only work with one Micro-SIM. However, the company could not clarify whether the second tray will still have the same hybrid design and whether the markings explicitly describing it as a Nano-SIM tray will be visible as they are on our review sample. If this is not changed on units hitting the market here, customers are likely to be confused and frustrated. All other specifications of our test unit were consistent with what Honor is advertising in India.A
 Micro-USB port sits on the bottom of the phone along with a microphone 
for calls. The 3.5mm jack, infrared port and another microphone are 
on the top. The rear houses the dual cameras, flash and the 
speaker. The word 'honor' is also imprinted on the rear. The front 
is dominated by the display and Huawei has placed the earpiece, 
secondary camera, and notification LED above it. There are three 
onscreen buttons - Recents, Home, and Back - for navigating through the 
Android operating system. A nice trick is that Huawei allows users to 
adjust this navigation bar according their preference. The 
5.5-inch IPS LCD has a resolution of 1080x1920, which translates to a 
pixel density of approximately 401ppi. The display is rich in colours 
and is very vibrant too, but it doesn't get too bright. Thankfully, this doesn't really affect sunlight legibility. The 
viewing angles are pretty decent too. Specifications and softwareThe
 Honor 6 Plus uses a homegrown Hisilicon Kirin 925 octa-core SoC. The 
Kirin 925 uses ARM's big.LITTLE architecture with four Cortex A7 cores clocked at 1.3GHz and another four 1.8GHz Cortex A15 cores. The integrated GPU is a Mali-T628 MP4. There is an ample 3GB of RAM and 32GB of 
internal storage space on the Honor 6 Plus. The storage space can be 
expanded up to 128GB using a microSD card. The Honor 6 
Plus supports Indian LTE networks on the 2300MHz and 1800MHz frequency bands. Other connectivity options 
include Bluetooth v4.0, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct and NFC. The phone 
has two 8-megapixel cameras on the rear which can be used in tandem to shoot a 
composite 13-megapixel image. Moreover, using two cameras 
Honor claims that more light can be captured for a better shot. We'll 
check this out in the camera section of our review. Completing the trio is a front-facing 8-megapixel camera. There is a 
3600mAh battery under the hood which provides the juice. The phone
 runs Android 4.4.4 with the latest Emotion UI (EMUI) skin on 
top. Honor has cleaned up EMUI to include flat icons and a pastel
 colour palette, which is pleasing to the eye. The UI is also very 
nimble now. The magazine-style lockscreen, which we first
 saw in the Honor 6, is still present. There are a few software tweaks 
which are pretty useful. We particularly liked the Ultra battery mode, 
which only enables calls, messages and contacts. There is also an option
 to use One-hand UI mode that shrinks the keyboard, navigation bar and 
the phone UI to one corner of the screen. EMUI also includes a Suspend 
button which sticks to the edges of the screen and replicates the 
navigation bar on a half-wheel. We are unsure if the Suspend 
button will really be useful for many people. On the other hand, Huawei 
bundles useful third-party apps such as Kingsoft Office, Facebook and 
Twitter. CameraThe parallel camera setup does actually result in good low-light images. We can safely say that 
the Honor 6 Plus is the best Android phone to get in this price range if
 you enjoy any sort of low-light photography. In fact, the Super 
night mode in the camera app opens up the aperture and reduces the 
shutter speed drastically. It works best if you can find a way to keep 
the camera stable or on a tripod. However, the only problem with this 
mode is that elements of the image merge into each other and this 
creates a watercolour like effect. (Click for full size)In daylight shots, we saw that the camera can reproduce natural colours. We'd go as far as
 to say it is almost as good as the Microsoft Lumia 830's camera. In comparison 
with the Lumia 830, details are not as well-defined and there is some barrel distortion. The underlying software processing the 
images however manages to keep noise at bare minimum levels. You can choose to save larger 13-megapixel images, which are created by the phone using both rear cameras in tandem. The dual cameras can 
also be used together in the Wide aperture mode, which is something 
similar to what we've seen in the Lytro range of cameras or HTC One 
(M8)'s duo camera setup. In this mode, the large f/0.95 aperture of the 
lens comes into play and this can be adjusted all the way down to 
f/16. This works best when the subject and
 the background are well-defined. You can create a nice bokeh effect 
while taking shots, or recompose them after they have been captured. We
preferred the latter approach since it gave us more control over the 
areas we would like to focus on. (Click for full size)We captured a 1080p video but the lack of optical
 image stabilisation meant that it was quite shaky. Also, our test video had some areas that were clearly 
underexposed. The 8-megapixel front camera takes some very good selfies 
but it had a problem with handling whites and tended to overexpose them. 
That said, our test shots were well detailed and the beauty mode can 
help fix blemishes. (Click for full size)PerformanceThe Honor 6 Plus was
 a delight to use during the course of testing period because it worked 
without any hiccups or stutter. In fact, the Kirin 925 processor is 
tuned really well to work with EMUI  which explains the smooth frame 
rate of page turn animations. Games like Asphalt 8 and Dead Trigger 2 
ran smoothly and we didn't encounter any frame drops.  The phone scored a healthy 44,698 points in AnTuTu but the Quadrant score was below our expectations; the Honor 6 
Plus managed to log only 11,922 in that test. The phone scored 14,110 points 
in 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited and 17fps in GFXbench - both 
better than average scores. All our test videos, which included a heavily encoded 40Mbps sample, played without skipping frames or 
artefacting. The loudspeaker is one of the low points of the phone as 
it doesn't get loud enough and sounds tinny too. Similarly, the sound 
quality through headphones isn't too good either. There is a DTS mode 
and it only amplifies the sound, which is still not very loud without any change to the quality. We had a similar problem 
with the Honor 6 as well. Huawei needs to sort this problem out soon. The
 audio quality in calls is good but we faced call drops on more than one
 occasion in areas where there was low signal strength. The phone lasted a good 
11 hours and 26 minutes in our video loop battery test. This is a pretty good 
figure and one should be able extract at least a day and a half on 
moderate use out of the 3600mAh battery. VerdictWe had a 
lot of fun using the Honor 6 Plus and peg it to be one of the better 
Android phones we've reviewed in the recent past. The exceptional 
performance of its dual rear cameras is an added advantage since 
not many Android phones in the same price range can achieve that. Having
 said that, the price tag of Rs. 26,499 puts it in an interesting spot 
because the Samsung Galaxy S5 (Review | Pictures) has gone through multiple price revisions 
and at around Rs. 27,000 it is a real bargain. Also, the Nokia Lumia 830 (Review | Pictures) in the same price range will tempt camera lovers. We'd recommend the 
Honor 6 Plus to anyone who wants a phablet that can capture good 
photographs but if that isn't the number one priority, there are great 
alternatives such as the OnePlus One (Review | Pictures) and Motorola Moto X (Gen 2) (Review | Pictures).
