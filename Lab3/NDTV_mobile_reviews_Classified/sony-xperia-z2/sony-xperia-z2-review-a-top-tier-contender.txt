Sony Xperia Z2 Review: A Top-Tier Contender

Sony is steadily climbing up the smartphone market share rankings, 
thanks to recent launches that have worked very well in their price 
bands. The company has had its ups and downs over the years, with a few 
models that have caught on, but no long-running success till very 
recently. Samsung is the dominant force in India as far as Android 
phones go, and Sony is only just beginning to establish itself as an 
alternative, with a distinctive identity that extends through hardware 
and software design.With that said, even though the Xperia Z2 is a
 significant improvement over its predecessors, the Z and Z1, there 
isn't really any kind of standout feature for the company to shout 
about. Samsung's Galaxy S5 has its heart rate monitor and health-related
 accessories; HTC has created a dual-camera system for the new One (M8).
 That's what Sony is up against, and it will have a hard time pushing the
 Xperia Z2 even though all its important features and specifications are
 totally top-of-the-line.We've already tested the Galaxy S5 and 
One (M8), so now it's time to see whether the Xperia Z2 can take them 
on, and whether Sony's understated approach helps it or hurts it.Look and feelVisually,
 there isn't much to differentiate the Xperia Z2 from its predecessors. 
It's almost exactly the same size as the Z1, give or take a few 
millimetres here or there, but it is a bit lighter at 163g. Sony hasn't 
even freshened up its colour options - you still have only white, black 
and purple to choose between. It has the same blunt rectangular shape, 
like a slab of glass with slightly chiselled edges and corners. The
 front and back of our review unit were perfectly black, but the sides 
are silver with a very deep purple trim around the edges. It's extremely
 subtle and you'll only see it when the light catches it at a particular
 angle, which gives the whole phone a bit of character.The front 
face is almost completely black, thanks to the move to on-screen 
buttons. There's only a classic Sony logo on top, with the front camera 
lens peeking through the black glass next to it. You can barely see the 
twin cutouts in the plastic edging which house the front-firing stereo 
speakers, except when LEDs in the upper cutout light up to notify you of
 calls, messages or charge status.Sony's distinctive round power 
button is in its now-familiar spot in the middle of the right edge, with
 the volume rocker and camera shortcut button below it, and a flap above
 it protecting the microSD card slot. Sony's magnetic charging connector
 is on the opposite side, along with another flap which protects the 
Micro-USB charging port and SIM card slot.The flaps are lined 
with rubber, which was necessary to ensure waterproofing and 
dustproofing - Sony says the Xperia Z2 has an IP58 rating, which means 
it should be able to withstand up to 30 minutes of immersion in up to 
1.5m of freshwater. The 3.5mm headset jack on top isn't protected, and 
there are microphone holes on the top and bottom, but the rear panel 
isn't removable and the battery is sealed inside.The 
20.7-megapixel camera lens in ringed with silver and placed in the upper
 left corner of the rear panel, along with an LED flash. Despite the 
fact that all regulatory messages are hidden away on a retractable tab 
under the microSD card flap, Sony clearly couldn't resist littering the 
back with a logo for the camera, one for NFC, another Sony logo and an 
Xperia logo as well. Both the front and back are highly reflective and 
pick up fingerprints like crazy.The Xperia Z2 is a chunky phone, 
and it felt solid in our hands. It isn't the most comfortable to hold, 
and the edges where glass meets metal are just a bit too rough. Still, 
it feels solid and imposing, without being loud. We really like what 
Sony's managed to pull off - it's only a slight refinement of its 
predecessors' designs, but somehow doesn't feel old.Features and specificationsIt
 seems you can't be a flagship phone in 2014 without a Snapdragon 801 
processor (or equivalent). Sony has gone with the flow, but the one in 
the Z2 is a tiny fraction slower than the one in the M8, at 2.3GHz 
instead of 2.5GHz. On the other hand, there's 3GB of RAM rather than the
 2GB HTC went with.The 16GB of built-in storage can be expanded 
by up to 128GB. MicroSD cards of that capacity are rare and expensive 
now, but it's nice to know they'll work in the future. Wi-Fi b/g/n/ac 
and Bluetooth 4.0 are standard, but Sony also includes NFC. There's no 
infrared remote control, which is something both primary competitors 
offer.The screen is a large 5.2-inch full-HD display, and Sony 
has applied its Bravia-derived "Triluminous" and "X-reality for Mobile" 
buzzwords to it. The screen is pretty sharp, and blacks are indeed quite
 deep. It isn't the brightest or most vivid in its class, but it's still
 a fantastic screen to watch movies and play games on.Sony pays 
equal attention to sound, and there are plenty of buzzword-toting 
enhancements. The twin front-firing speakers definitely add an important
 dimension to movies and games too, and we wish this was more standard 
on smartphones.The other major feature is the 20.7-megapixel 
camera. Sony is particularly proud of it, touting the unusually high 
pixel count as well as a sensor that's claimed to be 30 percent larger 
than standard. We're particularly intrigued by the claim that the Z2's 
camera is "on par with [Sony's] compact digital cameras". Pretty much 
every parameter is touted as superior - low light performance, contrast,
 clarity, depth, colour accuracy, detail, and lack of noise. The dense 
sensor is even supposed to be able to replicate optical zoom, by trading
 image size for clarity.Of course there's also 4K video 
recording. If Samsung hadn't beaten Sony to market, this would have been
 an exclusive feature. If you step down to 720p, you can shoot at up to 
120fps and add a dramatic slow-motion effect to your clips.SoftwareAndroid
 4.4 brings several important improvements to the user interface, and 
Sony's Xperia UI customisations are also pretty extensive. For starters,
 the default wallpaper has a "live" swirl that animates on its own as 
you swipe between screens, and the whole thing keeps cycling between 
colours. It feels unnecessary and is often distracting, but of course 
you can just turn this off. Sony loads up the interface with its 
own branded apps and content - one of the first things you see on the 
default home screen is a widget called "What's New", which is basically 
an advertisement for assorted Sony content, though only themes and 
recommended third-party apps show up in India. The constant refreshing 
is bound to eat up 3G data, so you might want to get rid of this widget 
entirely. On the next home screen, there's a carousel of videos and an 
audio player widget, both of which lead to apps preloaded with Sony 
content. Two of the four icons in the dock also lead to Sony apps - Liv 
and Sony Music Jive, which might appeal to Indian buyers but didn't have
 to be so in our faces.The custom Walkman-branded music player 
can handle loads of formats including FLAC, but its design is quite 
frustrating. Amongst the several other apps are TrackID, a useful music 
identification service; WisePilot, a maps and traffic guide app; Sony 
Select, yet another app directory; Smart Connect, a tool to automate 
phone behaviour when accessories are plugged in; and Xperia Lounge, 
which displays - guess what? - even more Sony promotional content, 
except this time including special offers for Xperia device owners.Chrome
 is the default and only browser. There's also Facebook, Socialife News,
 Vine, Line, X4 Video Player, Pixlr Express, Google Drive, Box, 
LinkedIn, and a view-only version of MobiSystems OfficeSuite. Sony
 might have overdone it with the apps, but the general Xperia UI is 
surprisingly similar to stock Android. The notifications shade seems 
bare compared to Samsung's and LG's implementations, and even the 
Settings app is largely untouched. These are typically areas in which 
companies try to offer users more flexibility and personalisation. At 
least the app switcher includes four shortcuts to "small apps" - you can
 choose from a limited selection including the calculator, browser, 
screenshot utility, timer, Gmail, and calendar.CameraApart
 from the hardware described above, Sony has done a fair bit of work 
with its camera app. The default mode is Superior Auto, which hides most
 options in the interest of simplicity. Manual mode, despite its name, 
doesn't offer conventional manual controls, but instead lets you tweak 
settings and use different scene modes such as Soft Skin, Anti Motion 
Blur, Night Portrait, Document, Fireworks, and even a Gourmet mode, 
presumably for Instagram-worthy shots of your dinner.The third 
mode is 4K video - as it turns out, videos shot in the normal camera 
modes top out at 1080p. The other modes, or "camera apps", include Vine,
 Sweep Panorama, Timeshift Burst, and AR Effect. We've seen many of 
these before, and some are definitely less useful than others. AR Mode 
is just for silly fun, Background Defocus doesn't always work or look 
realistic even though you can tweak it manually, and Social Live is only
 for compulsive Facebook sharers.(Click to see full size)Image quality is very 
impressive. We were able to take some great shots, including difficult 
subjects such as moving cars, birds in flight, and areas half in and 
half out of shadow. Colours were accurate and focusing was usually spot 
on, but our mileage varied when it came to capturing detail. Close-up 
shots fared better than landscapes. We even got some decent 
depth-of-field effects without any post-processing trickery. Low-light 
shots were impressive - in our limited testing, the flash lit up 
subjects evenly and even without it, there wasn't as much noise as we 
expected.The camera on the Xperia Z2 is truly impressive, and we 
can easily imagine people buying this phone just to have something this 
impressive in their pockets all the time. (Click to see full size)PerformanceSurprisingly,
 raw performance was a mixed bag with the Sony Xperia Z2. We never felt 
any slowdowns or lag in general usage, but our CPU-bound benchmarks 
produced consistently lower scores on this phone than they did on the 
Samsung Galaxy S5 and HTC One (M8). Variations ranged from slight to 
dramatic, but we wouldn't put down the Z2 for this since it's known that
 HTC and Samsung have manipulated benchmark scores in the past (and at 
least HTC proudly continues to do so now). Even with that in mind, the Xperia Z2 is a phenomenally fast phone, and is right at the top of the charts, ahead of last year's best performers.The graphics-intensive
 tests were much more evenly matched between the three flagship phones. 
We did, however, notice the Xperia Z2 getting almost uncomfortably hot 
when running demanding tasks.Audio and video were both excellent,
 and the 1080p screen is just large enough to make videos immersive 
without compromising on sharpness. Volume was impressive, even if the 
sound wasn't all that rich or clear in action scenes heavy EDM tracks.The
 battery lasted for 11 hours, 42 minutes in our video rundown test. That
 should be more than enough to get through a full day's work, including 
relatively heavy video and camera usage.VerdictWhatever 
Sony's doing, it seems to be working. The third iteration of its top-end
 Xperia Z model is the slickest yet, with all the features that anyone 
today might care about, in a package that is as understated as it seems 
possible to create. This is undoubtedly one of the most satisfying 
phones to own and use.With that said, it is still a bit too large
 for many people's tastes - we hope a Z2 Compact is on its way - and the
 squared-off body makes it a bit less comfortable to hold and use than 
the Galaxy S5 and One (M8). Those two phones also have their own 
defining features, which are admittedly pretty attractive.The Z2 
doesn't stick its neck out with anything groundbreaking, but it is 
probably the most well-rounded of the three (and Sony's launch offers don't hurt either). It's hard to pick between 
them, so you'll have to decide based on personal preferences. We're 
happy that Sony has delivered such a strong contender - Samsung 
definitely isn't the only game in town anymore.  Sony Xperia Z2 in pictures
