Sony Xperia Z2: First impressions

I typically have headphones on when
 I'm home in New York, whether it's during a jog or a commute. I often 
crank the volume up, at the risk of hearing loss, so that I could hear 
my favorite podcasts over loud subways and honking cars.I was 
excited to see noise-cancelling technology in Sony's new Xperia Z2 
smartphone. I've resisted investing in pricey noise-cancelling sets 
because I'm prone to lose or break them. If it's going to be built into a
 phone, perhaps I can use that instead of my iPod.Alas, I find 
the new feature to be more promise than practical, based on the brief 
time I had with the phone at this week's Mobile World Congress wireless 
show in Barcelona, Spain.But first, I'll go through other 
features that may appeal to some people. The phone is due to come out in
 March. Sony hasn't announced a price, though its phones typically sell 
for $500 to $600 in the U.S. without subsidies or a contract.WaterproofSony's smartphones are distinctive in being waterproof. It's
 not something I've felt that I've needed, but you might find it useful 
if you work as a lifeguard or live near a beach.20.7-meagpixel cameraThat's even better than the 16 megapixels in Samsung's new 
Galaxy S5. But lens quality and the focus mechanism are also important. I
 didn't get to try out the Z2's camera, but it's the same one in the 
Xperia Z1s, which I've had mixed results with.4K video recordingIt's impressive that the phone can capture video with four 
times the details as full high-definition video. But 4K displays are 
still expensive, so you won't appreciate the extra sharpness for a 
while. It's more for people who want to take quality video now for the 
day 4K becomes more common.Now, back to the noise. The phone 
analyzes ambient noise and produces a countering signal. In simple 
terms, if the noise is a 7, the phone subtracts 7 to bring it to zero. 
If the noise is a 5, the phone subtracts 5.Unfortunately, it 
requires special in-ear headphones, which Sony is selling for 60 euros 
($82). A sensor in the earpiece detects the noise, so the phone knows 
what countering signal to send. This approach keeps the headphones 
smaller and cheaper than typical noise-cancelling headphones.Noise cancellation is optimized for the office, for planes and for buses or trains. You choose one in the settings.I
 tried the headphones surrounded by simulated train and plane noise. The
 technology works, but it doesn't filter out the external noise 
completely. It also requires me to press the earpiece deep into my ears 
to notice a difference.Sony tells me the earpiece covers come in 
three sizes, so a larger one might have helped. I look forward to 
testing the feature more thoroughly.For now, I'll keep my iPod. MWC 2014 in pictures
