Oppo Find 7: First Impressions

Oppo is a relatively new entrant to the Indian smartphone market and is 
far from overtaking any of its competitors in the country, but that 
hasn't stopped it from raising the bar with its new flagship smartphone,
 the Find 7.The Chinese 
handset maker entered the Indian market in January with the N1, which sported a unique swivel camera. This was a big highlight,
 but the smartphone did not find that many takers due to its high 
pricing (16GB at Rs. 39,999) and the fact that its availability was 
limited to 12 cities.Now, the company hopes to make a good 
impression in the country with its latest Find series handset. The Oppo 
Find 7, which now is the country's first smartphone to boast of a 
Quad-HD (QHD) screen, has been priced at Rs. 37,990. The Chinese handset maker also announced a 'lite' variant of the Find 7, dubbed Find 7a, which will be available in the market starting Thursday, priced at Rs. 
31,990.Oppo may have had to stretch itself a bit while hyping the
 N1 in India, but when it comes to the Find 7, it's a definite 
heavyweight contender.There's a lot to like about the Find 7 - 
among them, is the QHD screen which the company hopes will elevate the 
handset to a more premium plane somewhere beyond its predecessor device,
 the N1.NDTV Gadgets had a chance to spend some time with the Find 7 and we came out impressed by Oppo's latest offering. Build, design and displayAt
 first glance, the white Oppo Find 7 that we played with looked like an 
elongated version of any Android phablet available in the Indian market.
 The smartphone feels glossy, smooth, and thin. It measures 152.6mm 
tall, 75mm wide, and 9.2mm thick.The build is pretty sturdy, in 
the company's established polycarbonate tradition, with two chamfered 
metal rims around the sides. Compared to some current flagships such as 
the Galaxy S5 (Review | Pictures) and One (M8) 
(Review
 | Pictures), the Find 7 doesn't have any contours - the design is very 
basic yet modern.Yes, it is a bit too wide for single-handed 
operation, and those blessed with smaller palms will find it tiring to 
carry the device around. However, if you have handled big-screened 
handsets comfortably in the past, you won't have any quibble with the 
Find 7.The front panel is completely dominated by the 5.5-inch 
screen, with no branding or physical buttons visible. We also quite 
liked the pulsing blue notification light present at the bottom of the 
front. The back panel houses the primary camera accompanied by a 
dual-LED flash, and the loudspeaker grille at the bottom. Oppo's logo is
 also embossed in the middle.The right edge houses the volume 
rocker, while the power button is on the left. Notably, the Find 7 does 
not feature a unibody design. The top has the 3.5mm headset port, while 
there is a charging port on the bottom. Unlike the Oppo N1, this one has
 a removable rear panel and a swappable battery. The Micro-SIM and 
microSD card slot sit alongside the battery. In terms of design, we feel
 as though the Find 7 radiates understated class.The Oppo Find 7 
boasts a 5.5-inch QHD IPS display, offering a massive resolution of 
1440x2560 pixels, which translates to an impressive 538ppi pixel 
density. The screen comes with Gorilla Glass 3 protection.It's 
worth pointing out that LG's recently launched flagship, the G3 also sports a 
Quad-HD screen offering the same screen resolution and pixel density as 
the Find 7. For those unaware, Quad-HD refers to four times as many 
pixels as one can find in a HD (720p) screen.The Find 7's display
 impressed us with its rich colour production, and easily looks more 
vibrant than any other smartphone currently available in the Indian 
market. We compared the display of the Find 7 with Apple's iPhone 5 
which looked nowhere close to the former. Specifications and performanceThe
 Oppo Find 7 is powered by a 2.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 (MSM8974AC)
 processor and comes with 32GB of inbuilt storage with expandable 
storage support via microSD card (up to 128GB).Other flagships - 
the HTC One (M8), Samsung Galaxy S5 (international variant) and Sony 
Xperia Z2 - also use the Snapdragon 801 (MSM8974AB). The Find 7 features
 3GB of RAM, which is more than the 2GB RAM found on the Galaxy S5 and 
One (M8) and the same as the Xperia Z2.The Oppo Find 7 
easily handled multitasking, and we observed that apps opened and closed
 instantaneously. Performance-wise, the Find 7 fared well in our limited
 testing. While zipping between home screens on the Find 7, we 
encountered no lag. It also handled full-HD and 2K videos (preloaded on 
the handset) with ease.Connectivity options on the Find 7 include Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, USB OTG, Wi-Fi Direct, GPS, GLONASS, and NFC.The
 company is touting that the Find 7 can be charged four times faster 
than other phones, thanks to the a rapid charging system called VOOC. 
The company claims that a five-minute charge is enough to allow a 
two-hour call, which we could obviously not test in our limited time 
with the device. Camera and softwareThe Oppo Find 7
 sports a 13-megapixel rear camera with a Sony Exmor IMX214 sensor and 
LED flash, as well as a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with a BSI 
sensor. Oppo also claims it can take 50-megapixel photos with the Super 
Zoom feature. The Find 7 can record 4K videos and also 720p videos at 
120fps for slow motion effects.In our limited testing, the 4K 
video recording feature on the Find 7 looked impressive, and images 
taken in both well-lit and low-light conditions looked brilliant.The
 Oppo Find 7 runs a highly customised version of Android 4.3 (Jelly 
Bean), which the company calls ColorOS 1.2. The UI appears to be a total
 departure from the usual Android experience. Final wordsThe
 Oppo Find 7 will be hitting markets by July at a price of Rs. 37,990. 
Notably, the Find 7 has been priced below some of the flagships such as 
the Sony Xperia Z2 (Review
 | Pictures), Samsung Galaxy S5, and HTC One (M8).It is yet to be
 seen whether the Find 7, with its impressive specs and interesting 
features, can be a hit in a price-conscious and brand-conscious market 
like India.You can expect more detailed observations and testing when we review the Find 7. Oppo Find 7 in pictures
