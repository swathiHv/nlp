 Intex Aqua Style Pro Review: Average Performance, Average Value

For
 a company known for making computer accessories, Intex's transformation 
into a mobile-first company is a sign of the times, where smartphones are the most important product category. Competition is fierce and price wars are constantly being fought. The entry of 
Xiaomi's Redmi 1S in the sub-Rs. 8,000 price segment has heated things up even more. Intex's new offering, the 
Aqua Style Pro, touts the latest version of Android, KitKat, and costs a shade below Rs. 7,000. Let's see if it can tread these waters 
without drowning.Look and feelIt feels like yet another day when yet 
another candybar phone from a local brand hits the retail market. There is absolutely nothing distinctive about 
the Intex Aqua Style Pro with respect to its design. It is bland 
and looks like just about every other Android phone out there. The Aqua Style Pro is made of plastic and when
 we first picked it up, our impression was that it is 
pretty light. The phone weighs 120g and has a girth of 8.8mm 
making it comfortable to hold as well. The primary camera sticks out of the rear which looks odd. The rear has a slimy matte black 
finish. The rear panel comes off rather easily to reveal the 1800mAh battery, two
 SIM card slots and a memory card slot. The front is taken up 
mostly by the 4.5-inch screen which is surrounded by a thick, ungainly border. Below the screen are the three three capacitive navigation buttons - back, home and menu. Along 
with a front-facing camera above the display, there is an earpiece. The 
power button is on the right edge and the volume rocker is on the left. Specifications and softwareThe
 hardware components inside the Intex Aqua Style Pro can't hold a candle
 to some of the competing phones in the same price range. However, we 
are only talking about the specifications on paper and not the real-life
 performance, which may vary.The phone has a quad-core Broadcom 
BCM23550M processor clocked at 1.2GHz and 1GB of RAM for 
applications and services. For graphics, there is a relatively uncommon
Videocore IV GPU. Intex provides 8GB of internal storage, which 
is further expandable by up to 32GB using microSD cards. The 
8-megapixel rear camera is supported by a dual-LED flash for low-light 
situations. There is also a front-facing 2-megapixel rear camera for 
selfies. The dual-SIM phone can communicate via 3G, Wi-Fi b/g/n and 
Bluetooth. The 4.7-inch screen has a resolution of 
480x854 pixels. This translates to a density of around 218ppi. Colours are slightly oversaturated but the viewing angles are fine. Sunlight legibility is not too great, though. As we mentioned earlier,
 the phone runs Android 4.4.2 (KitKat).There is absolutely nothing new 
or noteworthy here since most of the design is 
stock Android. A few third-party apps are pre-installed. 
They include Clean Master, File Manager, Intex Games Club, Intex Zone, 
OLX, Quickoffice and Real Football 2014. Clean Master does exactly what 
its name suggests: clear up RAM space. Similarly, File Manager can be used to view all the files on your phone. Intex 
Games Club is a shortcut to a Web page selling (what seem like) Java games. OLX is an app for a marketplace where 
people can sell and buy anything. Quickoffice lets users read/edit 
documents on the go. The most annoying inclusion is Real 
Football 2014 which isn't the full-fledged 3D game we expected but 
rather a Java replica.  Thankfully, it can be uninstalled.CameraThe
 8-megapixel rear camera on the phone is slow and the app is tedious to 
use. The camera app is a mashup of the older Gingerbread app and 
the current app. Manual settings are in the form of options for contrast and sharpness, which we think is totally pointless.Images captured in daylight look really good on the screen of the phone. We zoomed in a 
little and immediately noticed that something was amiss. The entire 
picture looked like someone had painted on top of the screen using watercolours. The details were completely missing. Noise was kept to a 
minimum but it was at the cost of smudging all the details. Take a look 
at the leaves on the trees in the image below.(click for full size)In low light, the 
image quality deteriorates even further. The colours are off and there 
are no details whatsoever. At its highest setting the camera can capture
 480p videos, which is essentially Standard Definition (SD) from the 
Nokia N95 era. Video quality on the Intex Aqua Style Pro is really 
bad. The N95 took better videos. The front camera is not up to the mark 
either. PerformanceWe were hopeful of the phone's 
performance considering the unexciting specifications list. 
However, the Aqua Style Pro started lagging from the start. Browsing 
through the app drawer is a slow process, and apps take time to open and
 close. This is backed up by our benchmark numbers. In the AnTuTu and
 Quadrant tests, the phone managed to log scores of 12,643 and 3,424; 
well below the level of competing phones in this price range. The graphics tests 
scores were worse. In GFXbench and 3D Mark Ice Storm, the phone
 scored 6.8fps and 4,368 respectively. The Videocore IV GPU is not up to
 task here. In our video playback test, the phone couldn't play 
720p videos, let alone 1080p ones. In fact, even the SD video stuttered 
during playback. In our video loop test, the battery lasted us 6 hours 
and 7 minutes, which is above the class average. The speaker is 
adequately loud but distorts at high volume. The bundled earphones sound
 really hollow and those looking for better sounds should replace them. 
The call quality was good. The phone didn't drop network even once. VerdictAt
 the time of writing this review, the Intex Aqua Style Pro is available 
for Rs. 6,990. While this makes it cheaper than a lot of other devices, the below-average performance makes it seem like a very good idea to spend a little more for a better device. We think the Asus Zenfone 4 (review | pictures), Motorola 
Moto E (review | pictures), Micromax Unite 2 (review | pictures) and Xiaomi Redmi 1S (review | pictures) are much better 
options. Take your pick from one of them instead.
