Lenovo S660 Review: A Well-Balanced Workhorse

Slowly but surely, Lenovo is building up a strong
 reputation in the Indian smartphone market. The company might not have 
the most glamorous product portfolio, but the majority of its offerings 
have offered good value and have been well received. We recently spent 
some time with the high-end Vibe Z and came away with mostly positive 
impressions.Today's review subject is a much more value-minded 
model, the Lenovo S660. It's priced right in one of the busiest and 
fastest growing segments of the Indian smartphone market, the Rs. 9,000 -
 Rs. 14,000 price band. Look and feelThe Lenovo S660's 
design is purely functional, and it doesn't even try to be the slimmest 
or most stylish in any sense. That's great news, because we appreciate 
it when a company goes for simple practicality. The S660 is a bit chunky
 and feels very comfortable in the hand. It's easy to hold on to, thanks
 to the curved back, but we would have liked it to have been a bit 
lighter.The front face is as plain as it gets - Lenovo likes 
slapping large logos on its products, and there's one centered right 
above the screen. The capacitive buttons below the screen are barely 
visible, but light up when you touch them or any part of the screen. The
 rim around the edges and the earpiece grille are a muted gunmetal 
colour, but are made of plastic. The left edge is blank, and the power 
and volume buttons are all on the right. They protrude a little, making 
them easy to find and use. There's a headset jack on the top edge and a 
Micro-USB port on the bottom.The rear panel is metal and has a 
brushed metal texture. There's a squared-off camera lens with a small 
LED flash and mic hole nearby, another (much larger) Lenovo logo, and a 
speaker grille all neatly aligned down the centre.It takes quite a
 bit of effort to pop the cover off, which you'll need to do to get to 
the battery, microSD slot and dual SIM card slots. The S660 can take two
 regular-sized SIM cards, though we weren't really happy with the way 
both need to be sandwiched one on top of another.Features and specificationsAs
 with most smartphones in and around this price range today, the S660 is
 built around a MediaTek system-on-a-chip. In this case it's the 
quad-core MT6582M, running at 1.3GHz with integrated 416MHz Mali-400 MP2
 graphics. The primary difference between this SoC and the more common 
MT5582 is that its graphics core runs slightly slower.The S660 
has 1GB of RAM, which is just about adequate, and 8GB of internal 
storage space. It supports microSD cards of up to 32GB. There's 
Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi b/g/n - thankfully both modern standards - plus 
an accelerometer, proximity sensor and ambient light sensor.The 
screen is a bit disappointing. The qHD resolution, or 540x960, is rather
 low considering the screen measures 4.7 inches diagonally. It's bright 
enough though, and has excellent viewing angles. It's good enough for 
casual gaming and watching movies, which is what's important at this 
price range.The other disappointment is that this phone still 
runs Android 4.2 and is designed around the older Android button layout.
 Quite a few competitors now offer Android 4.4 which itself isn't all 
that modern anymore. In terms of software, we're also not huge fans of 
Lenovo's custom UI. Most of what we said in our review of the Vibe Z 
holds true here as well - we're once again annoyed by the 
merged-home-screen-and-app-launcher approach. The S660's version of the 
UI includes a distracting iOS 7-style zoom animation when opening and 
closing folders, and a weird orange blush spreads across the screen when
 you hit the top or bottom of any scrolling list. Unlike witih the Vibe 
Z, the settings menu, notification drawer and app switcher interfaces 
are the stock Android designs, but with a bit of visual customisation. 
You also don't get all the shortcuts and UI tweaks that Lenovo bestowed 
upon its premium device.Apps include Lenovo's own SECUREit, 
SYNCit and SHAREit utilities, Kingsoft Office, Navigate 6, Facebook, 
Skype, Twitter, and Evernote. For some reason, Lenovo has preinstalled 
Chrome and UCBrowser in addition to the stock Android browser. Lenovo
 also throws in a neat snap-on case with a central spine that can curl 
up, much like the toy wristbands available for children, to act as a 
stand. While this is a neat idea, we found it was just a bit too easy to
 snap the spine, making the whole experience of using the phone with 
this cover on it a bit clumsy.CameraThe S660's camera is surprisingly competent in daylight. Photos lack depth and are a little grainy, but the quality is definitely good enough for shots that you just want to share online. Subjects close by are defined pretty well, but backgrounds tend to become indistinct clumps of colour - this holds true for photos as well as video. Low-light shots don't fare as well, and our test shots were all very noisy. The front camera is barely passable for video chatting - photos have an odd purple tinge and generally poor quality. Videos taken with the rear camera were passable, but that's about it.The camera app defaults to taking 6-megapixel photos and 720p video, which you can manually change to 8 megapixels and 1080p. The camera app has an HDR mode which definitely improves vibrancy, but can leave photos looking rather artificial. The mode is available via a slidable icon bar at the top of the camera app.There are also modes for panorama shots, auto scene detection, best shot, EV Bracket mode, and multi-angle shots. Some of these could have done with a bit of explanation for new users, but there's very little on-screen guidance.(Click to see full size)PerformanceBenchmark
 scores were pretty much at par with those of other phones based on the 
same MediaTek SoC family, such as the Oppo R1 and Micromax Canvas Turbo 
Mini. As expected, scores in graphically intensive tests such as 
GFXbench and 3DMark were very low. We managed 8.6fps in GFXbench, as 
opposed to the Oppo R1's score of 6.5fps with a faster clocked GPU. That
 could be down to the R1's slim body preventing heat dissipation, or its
 higher resolution screen requiring more grunt. You won't be able to run
 any 3D games on this device, although casual titles seem to run 
perfectly well.The CPU scores were more or less identical across 
the two phones. In our review of the R1, we noted that you could get 
much better performance for what you'd be paying. In the case of the 
S660, which sells for well under half that price, we think its scores 
are pretty reasonable. We have no problem with how the phone 
handles itself in day-to-day usage. Interface animations and transitions
 are smooth, and apps load quickly enough. Basic games, photo editing 
tools, social networking and messenger apps should work well, but don't 
expect to be doing any heavy multitasking.The S660's battery is 
pretty large at 3,000mAh, and battery life is one of Lenovo's talking 
points about this phone. We saw some odd behaviour in our battery test -
 in the beginning, the phone dropped from 100 percent to around 80 
percent alarmingly quickly. It seemed as though the phone was losing 
about one percentage point per minute, which was so unbelievable that we
 aborted our test midway and started again twice. The behaviour 
persisted, but then the drainage improved so much so that the phone 
lasted well over an hour between the time it hit 2 percent and the time 
it shut itself down. We ended up with a total of 7 hours and 38 minutes 
in our video loop test which is pretty good, but, for the record, Lenovo
 seriously needs to work out its battery calibration issues.The 
loudspeaker was extremely tinny and harsh, and sound distorted even at 
medium volume levels. Call quality, on the other hand, was pretty good. 
Video playback was fine for resolutions up to 720p, but attempting to 
play 1080p video was pretty much pointless. VerdictWe're 
impressed with what Lenovo has managed to pull off at this price point. 
It matches or exceeds the specifications and performance of most other 
phones at this price point, such as the Nokia Lumia 630 and XL, the HTC 
Desire 310, the Lava Iris Pro 20 and Iris Pro 30, and even in some respects, the Motorola Moto G. What you get is a solid phone with well-balanced specifications and capabilities at a very reasonable price. Lenovo seems to have understood the value end of the market very well. The S660 might not be very glamorous, but it doesn't let us down in any department and is still quite attractive. The only thing we could really hope for would be a software update.The 8GB version of the Moto G sells 
for roughly the same price, has a better screen and runs the very latest
 version of Android, but doesn't have a microSD card slot. If the 16GB 
Moto G stretches your budget too far, you'll find that the Lenovo S660 
is a more than worthy substitute. Lenovo S660 in pictures
