Samsung Galaxy Note 4: First Impressions

After years of promoting its phones as "the next big thing," Samsung is realizing that bigger isn't necessarily better.Two
 new Galaxy Note smartphones from Samsung are about the same size as 
last year's Note 3. What's different: A side screen on one of them and 
sharper cameras on both. Samsung also unveiled new wearable devices, 
including a virtual-reality headset, as part of its holiday lineup. The 
devices won't start selling until October or later, and prices for most 
haven't been announced yet.Based on about an hour with these new 
gadgets at a Samsung event in New York, I find them impressive. But 
whether that's enough to win over potential iPhone customers will depend
 on what app developers do with these new features.There's 
speculation Apple will unveil the iPhone 6 in two sizes next week, with 
the larger one at 5.5 inches. If that's the case, Samsung loses much of 
its size advantage and will have to make a compelling case for these 
other features.Galaxy Note phonesSamsung's Galaxy Note 
phones have always been too big for me, but I know some people prefer 
larger screens because text is easier to read and video is easier to 
watch.The new Galaxy Note 4 is a successor to last year's Note 3 and 
retains its 5.7-inch screen. The Galaxy Note Edge's screen is 5.6 inches and 
extends over the right edge and curves toward the back, creating a 
second display on the side.The side display is my favorite of the
 new phone features. It can show weather and time while the phone is 
laid on a table or nightstand. You can add icons for quick access to 
apps you use frequently, such as Gmail or Netflix. You also get a panel 
of tools such as the flashlight. This panel is something Apple's iPhone
 have had for a year, and I'm glad to finally see it on an Android 
phone.But it's too early to tell whether this side screen will 
ultimately be essential or merely a gimmick. Seeing weather and time on 
the side while in bed is neat, but I could simply grab the phone and 
check the home screen. I do that all the time when texts come in and the
 alarm clock rings.It will take app developers - at Samsung and 
elsewhere - to invent new uses for that side screen. Their willingness 
to spend time on that could depend on how many people buy Edge phones, 
and how many people buy Edge phones could depend on what app developers 
do with it. See the quandary?Both phones have 16-megapixel rear 
cameras to match that in the 5.1-inch Galaxy S5 (Review | Pictures). The front cameras offer
 3.7 megapixels, better than most phones. Software will help more people
 fit into selfies by stitching together a few side-by-side images. I'm 
not a big taker of selfies as I look awful in them, but those who take a
 lot might appreciate this feature and the better front camera.The
 Note phones also borrow some concepts from personal computers. The 
button on the included stylus will act like the mouse button on PCs. 
There are new ways to resize windows and have multiple apps run side by 
side on the same screen. This won't work with every app, so its 
usefulness will depend on how many bother to adopt the feature.Gear VR HeadsetThe
 VR is a $200 helmet with a slot for attaching the Note 4 phone at eye 
level, so you're looking at the phone's display up close as if you were 
seeing through goggles. The VR has sensors to gauge your head's position
 and instructs the phone which part of a 360-degree, spherical video to 
display.If you look down, for instance, the VR tells the phone to
 show you what the floor in the video looks like. Turn around to see 
what's behind you. I felt as though I was attending a Coldplay concert 
as the portion of the video I see changes as I look up, down and around.
 Likewise, a lion and elephants appeared up close as I watched video of 
an African safari.The visuals were impressive, though I got dizzy after a few minutes and had to remove the VR to return to reality.This
 device will need compelling content to be useful. Gamers might like 
this, but everyday consumers could tire of it quickly. Samsung could 
face the same problem it does with the side screen: Consumers won't buy 
it without enough content, and enough content won't be available without
 consumers.Making things tougher is the fact that the VR works 
only with the Note 4 - not even the Edge. And there's no guarantee the 
VR will work with future phones such as a Note 5. That will further 
limit the VR's appeal.Gear S SmartwatchSmartwatches 
have been constrained in requiring a companion smartphone nearby. If 
that's the case, do you really need a second device to check email and 
Facebook? I can just check the phone.The Gear S tries to solve 
that by working independently. It has its own SIM card, so it can grab 
notifications and other data over a 3G cellular connection. You can have
 calls from your main phone forwarded to the watch, as long as the phone
 is from Samsung. You can also make calls from the watch, but it'll 
appear as coming from a different number than your main phone. It's not 
yet clear how your wireless carrier will charge for service. Does it 
count as its own phone line, or is it a connected device, which costs 
less for service?The watch also has a GPS sensor, so your runs 
are more accurately tracked than what the watch's pedometer can do. It 
also offers turn-by-turn directions for walking, using Here Maps from 
Nokia.The Gear S is one to watch - no pun intended - though it's not certain yet whether Samsung will release it in the U.S.
