Nokia Asha 502 review

Nokia, the Finnish smartphone and tablet maker, has always been 
considered a game changer in the ever-evolving smartphone industry. As a
 rival to other world leaders including Samsung and Apple, the firm fell
 behind for a while but has now made a huge comeback with its line of 
Lumia devices running the Windows Phone OS.At last year's Nokia 
World event, the company introduced six new handsets. While the high-end
 phablets took the spotlight, Nokia also made sure that it still caters 
to the needs of its budget customers. Introduced at the event, the Nokia
 Asha 502 budget smartphone is a shining example of how hard the firm is
 still trying to take over the low-end smartphone market by stuffing a 
bunch of impressive features into a small-sized device.The Nokia Asha 502 is the successor to the Asha 501, and has some noticeable bodily and internal OS feature tweaks.In
 hand, the Asha 502 feels both compact and strong. We found its build 
and overall design very appealing, and the phone itself is comfortable 
to carry around.After spending a decent amount of time with the 
Asha 502, testing its battery life, camera, Internet connectivity, 
gaming capabilities and much more, here is what we think about this 
budget handset.Build quality and designThe Nokia Asha 502 
is extremely comfortable to hold, as its sharp corners give the user a 
better grip and reduce the chances of it slipping and falling. The small
 device measures 99.6 x 59.5 x 11.1mm and is well suited for users who 
have average or small hands. One its most distinctive features is the 
plastic monoblock body. The entire back panel and all four edges of Asha
 502 are encased in a transparent material, giving the handset a 
crystallized effect. Dedicated hard keys are usually found on the
 sides of a handset, and Nokia offers exactly what a user needs. Both 
the lock key and the two volume keys are closely placed on the right 
side of the handset, but are not so close that a user could accidently 
press the wrong button. The buttons are easy to locate even in 
low-light situations as they are slightly elevated from the body 
surface. There is no dedicated camera button, but the feature can be 
accessed with a single swipe on the touchscreen.The Nokia Asha 
502 has a small microphone on the bottom-right corner along with a 
Micro-USB connector and a 3.5mm headphone port placed on the left and 
right of the top panel respectively. Nokia has given the left edge of 
the handset a clean look. The rear panel has a camera centred at the 
top, with a small but powerful LED flash to its right. Just below the 
camera, a large Nokia logo is embossed into the transparent sheath. 
There's a thin speaker on the bottom, leaving the rest of the rear panel
 blank.The front panel houses a small 3-inch screen and a speaker
 grille, with Nokia's logo between them. Below the screen is a single 
capacitive touch button for going back to the previous screen or closing
 apps.On removing the Asha 502's back panel, one can see the 
removable battery taking up most of the space, with slots for the first 
SIM just above it. The slots for the second SIM and microSD card are on 
either side.DisplayThe Nokia Asha 502's 3-inch screen is 
smaller than those of other devices in the same price segment. Users 
coming from phones with 4-5-inch screens might be able to get used to 
it, but if you like the feel of phablet devices that are currently 
popular, you'll find the small screen cumbersome to operate.The 
Nokia Asha 502's multi-touch screen features a QVGA (320 x 240 pixels) 
resolution. The screen can display only 256,000 colours as opposed to 
the full range of 1.6 million colours that is the usual standard. When 
set to full brightness, the screen is easily visible under direct 
sunlight.Software/InterfaceThe Nokia Asha 502 runs on the 
latest Asha OS, version 1.1, which is an update to the software used by 
the Asha 501. The OS uses simple swipe gestures for most actions, and 
the back button is mainly used to close apps and return to the main menu
 screen.The Asha 502, like other Asha models, comes with a 
feature called Fastlane, which helps users access apps quickly, without 
searching through the main apps page. The Fastlane window shows the apps
 which have been used most recently. One can navigate to the Fastlane 
view by unlocking the device and simply swiping towards the right from 
the main apps page. As seen on Nokia's higher-end handsets 
running Windows Phone 8 OS, the Nokia Asha 502 also allows users to 
change the positions of icons or delete entire apps by simply 
long-pressing on any icon. The settings app gives you direct 
access to the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Flight Mode, and Dual-SIM settings, 
amongst others. The Personalisation section lets you select ringtones 
and vibration settings along with the wallpaper, lock screen image and 
Fastlane settings. Since the Asha 502 is a budget handset, users 
will have to put up with limited customisation options for things like 
the Fastlane settings, and limited background apps.The phone 
struggles to load heavy websites in its browser, but it can run 
optimised Java games such as Assassin's Creed 3 and Asphalt 6: Heat. The
 graphics are not impressive, and users who expect even average quality 
graphics will be disappointed. The Asha 502 includes one of the 
most useful features that Nokia recently added to its Lumia phones, the 
Glance screen. Glance shows the time and notifications on the screen 
even after the phone has gone into standby mode. Nokia's Xpress 
browser opens most websites quickly because data goes through Nokia's 
server where it is compressed before being delivered. However, it fails 
when it comes to running heavy Java-enabled websites. Up to six tabs can
 be open at any time. Some of the popular apps which come preloaded on 
the device are Facebook, Twitter, Line, Wechat and WhatsApp. We also 
tried watching some Youtube videos on the handset, which turned out 
better than we expected. CameraEven though it's a budget 
device, the Asha 502 has a 5-megapixel fixed-focus rear camera with a 
f/2.4 aperture and an LED flash with a range of one metre. There's no 
front-facing camera and very few camera software features.  The 
camera interface of Asha 502 is pretty easy to operate. The camera app 
can be directly accessed from the lock screen by swiping upwards. Once 
open, you can long-press on the screen to access the camera settings 
which include flash adjustment options, self-timer, white balance, 
filters, camera shutter sound and a choice of five resolutions. The
 Asha 502's camera is just about average when it comes to image quality 
and clarity despite its 5-megapixel resolution. Images captured in 
bright sunny conditions look good, but like most such handsets, the Asha
 502 fails in low-light situations. You can't see much detail on the 
device's small screen, but images shot in low-light are grainy and 
unclear. Features and performanceIn use some stuttering 
was noticeable while swiping between screens, and there was a few 
seconds' lag while closing applications. However, by long-pressing the 
back button, we were able to kill apps faster. Nokia says you can 
double-tap the screen to wake the phone from sleep, but 6-10 were 
usually required before the feature worked.The phone has very 
little internal storage, with only a few MB free for users. However, the 
handset comes bundled with a 4GB microSD card, and you can use cards up 
to 32GB in size. We also noted that it took a considerable amount of 
time for the handset to show the contents of the memory card, which we 
suspect is due to the low amount of RAM.One of the features Nokia
 has been known for in India is call quality. The Asha 502 was decent 
enough, and it did not lose network connectivity even in basements. 
Similarly, people on the other end of our calls also reported clear 
quality.The 1010mAh battery was very impressive, as the phone made it through two consecutive days of usage with a single charge.The FM radio on Nokia Asha 502 is average and the headset needs to be plugged in for the application to work. The
 Nokia Asha 502 is undoubtedly a fingerprint magnet. After a little 
time, the screen as well as the crystalline cover will accumulate 
smudges, and you'll have to wipe the phone repeatedly to make it look 
good.VerdictTo sum it up in few words, the Nokia Asha 502 
is a very basic phone with the simplest features one can expect in this 
segment. The handset is best suited for light users, who will use it 
mainly for calls, texts and very occasional social networking. The
 handset lacks features that other manufacturers offer in this price 
range, such as  3G connectivity, bigger display, multi-touch 
functionality and a better processor for quick operations. A few 
alternatives to consider are Samsung Galaxy Pocket Neo, Samsung Rex 90 
and LG T585. The Asha 502 thus has a lot of room for improvement.The
 handset is priced at Rs. 5,739 on the official Nokia India website, but
 it can be bought for around Rs. 5,500 from online retailers such as 
Flipkart and Snapdeal.
