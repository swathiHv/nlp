HTC Droid DNA review

Over the past few years, smartphones have gradually gotten bigger and 
tablet computers have gotten smaller. So it should come as no surprise 
that devices in between are starting to emerge.These Android devices,
 informally known as phablets, are better described as giant phones than
 baby tablets, as they can be used for phone calls. And for now, they 
aren't much bigger than regular phones.The larger screens - 
measuring 5 inches or more diagonally make the devices slightly better
 for watching movies, reading books and consuming other media. They can 
also make the phones bulkier to carry - or so I thought.I was 
pleasantly surprised when I took HTC Corp.'s new 5-inch Droid DNA phone 
out of the box. The DNA looks about the same size as my 4.8-inch Samsung
 Galaxy S III, one of the largest and most popular phones out there. I 
had to find a ruler to make sure I wasn't sent the wrong phone.HTC
 succeeds by making the DNA taller rather than wider, which is important
 because the width is what spans your palm when you're holding it. 
Samsung Electronics Co.'s 5.5-inch Galaxy Note II feels too big in my 
hands - more on that later.The DNA is, in fact, a tad narrower 
than the S III, not enough to be noticeable, while being less than 
two-tenths of an inch larger on its longer side. The DNA is slightly 
thicker and heavier than the S III, though.I didn't believe I'd 
notice the small increase in screen size until I watched "Ice Age" on 
both the DNA and the S III side by side. But the difference is small. 
Although watching a movie on a DNA beats doing it on the older iPhone's 
3.5-inch screen or even the 4 inches on the new iPhone 5, it isn't the 
same as watching it on a 7-inch or 10-inch tablet computer. Get a real 
tablet if size matters to you.In most apps, I don't actually get 
more content with the bigger screen. Text and graphics in Gmail messages
 simply get slightly bigger on the DNA. Google's maps are larger, but 
that doesn't mean you see more surrounding area, just bigger parks and 
road names. Amazon's Kindle app squeezes in an extra word in a line here
 and there, but you lose those gains once you reach the next paragraph.The exceptions I spottedGoogle's Play Books app for reading e-booksThe text appears about the
 same size on the DNA and the S III, meaning the app can fit a few more 
lines on the DNA device.Facebook The app shows a tad more on 
the DNA when placed on its side like a movie screen. Side by side, it 
could mean seeing a bit more of a photo on the DNA, but it's not enough 
to fit in an extra post from someone whining about a morning commute - 
you'd have to scroll down for more status updates like that. Strangely, I
 get less on the DNA when using Facebook with the phone held like a 
skyscraper. A black horizontal bar serves as a menu for settings and 
other tasks; on the S III, that menu button is built into the hardware 
and doesn't take up screen space.Because the DNA's screen is only
 slightly bigger than the S III's, I can see why I'm not getting more 
content, just larger text, images and video. I figure I'd need the Note 
and its even larger screen to get all that. After all, on a tablet's 
7-inch or 10-inch screen, I'm seeing much more, not just everything 
bigger.But in my tests, everything just gets bigger on the Note 
compared with the S III. I'm seeing the same number of emails, the same 
coverage area for maps and the same amount of text for e-books. Think of
 it as moving a movie projector back so that the movie projects onto a 
larger area. You're not actually improving the quality or the size of 
the source material, the film. And if you move back far enough, what's 
shown on the screen starts to degrade.I see that degradation watching "Ice Age." The video just isn't as sharp on the Note.I
 soon discovered the reason: The S III and the Note both have the same 
number of pixels, those tiny dots that collectively form text and images
 on a screen. Both displays are 1,280 by 720 pixels, which translate to 
306 pixels per inch on the S III and 267 on the Note II. So the Note 
simply stretches the same amount of display information onto a wider 
area. That's a shame, as it negates much of the benefits of a larger 
screen.By contrast, the DNA's display is 1,920 by 1,080 pixels, 
or 440 pixels per inch. That's among the best out there. The iPhone 5, 
by contrast, is at 326 pixels per inch.That said, both Samsung 
phones have richer colors than the DNA, thanks to a screen that uses 
organic light-emitting diodes, rather than a standard LCD. Although 
video on the DNA is sharper, color isn't as vivid as it is on the S III 
or the Note. Still, the DNA's screen trumps that of many other phones, 
and video looks great if you're not watching a movie next to a Samsung 
phone.Available from Verizon Wireless for $200 with a two-year 
service agreement, the DNA also has a front-facing, videoconferencing 
camera that's among the best, at 2.1 megapixels. Its rear camera, for 
taking photos and video, matches the 8 megapixels that other major 
phones have. Sound comes out well thanks to the DNA's use of Dr. Dre's 
Beats Audio.As for the Note, it has a fine-tip stylus that can be
 used to add a handwritten signature to an email, circle an important 
event on your calendar or doodle on a virtual notepad. The on-screen 
keyboard has an extra row for numerals, so you don't have to keep 
toggling between letters and numbers when writing messages or entering 
passwords. The Note is available from a variety of carriers starting at 
$300 with a two-year contract.Both are decent phones, but not for
 their distinguishing feature - the size. The increase in size is barely
 noticeable on the DNA and annoying on the Note, which feels even 
bulkier with a built-in cover. It keeps bouncing in my pocket when I'm 
running, then feels as if it would slip out of my hands once I take it 
out. Checking voice mail feels awkward. The Note is also one-third 
heavier than the S III.Here's a case of trying to be too much. A 
phone is a phone and shouldn't try to grow into a tablet. After all, you
 don't see too many people hold up an iPad to their ears to make phone 
calls, even though you could with Skype and other calling apps.With
 the Note in particular, you get the annoyances of a tablet (something 
too big to easily carry around) and little of the benefits (fitting more
 content on the screen). Get the Note for the stylus, but not for the 
screen. Likewise, the DNA doesn't offer much in terms of screen size 
beyond other phones out there. Get the DNA for its sound quality or 
screen resolution, but not for the size of the display.There are 
sure to be bigger phones to come, and I hope they will offer more than 
just content shown bigger. App developers may have to do their part by 
designing their programs for varying screen sizes. Both the DNA and the 
Note have good features that set them apart from rivals, but size isn't 
one of them.
