Spice Coolpad Mi-515 review

Spice seems to be targeting the price conscious Indian market with its 
Android smartphones. The company is back with yet another offering, and 
rather than experimenting with an odd screen size, it's sticking to the 
5-inch phablet form factor, inline with the current trend.Spice 
recently tied-up with Chinese smartphone manufacturer, Coolpad, and the 
result was the launch of a co-branded, Spice Coolpad, range of 
smartphones in the Indian market. The Spice Coolpad Mi-515 is the
 first phone that's been introduced after the collaboration. Can the 
combination of decent hardware, Android Jelly Bean software and an 
attractive price point make this phone a desirable device? We try to 
find out in our review.Build/ DesignThe Spice Coolpad 
Mi-515 doesn't score much in the looks department. It looks like most 
other budget phablets available in the market. It's 140mm tall, 73mm 
wide and 9.9mm thick, and is definitely not a slim contender. The
 5.0-inch display dominates the front of the phone, with three 
capacitive touch buttons placed beneath the screen, while the earpiece, 
front-facing camera and the proximity sensor sit on the top of the 
screen with 'Coolpad' branding just below the earpiece. There's a
 metallic Blue frame around the device that adds to the aesthetic 
appeal. On the right side is the power key while the volume rocker key 
is located on the left side. The Micro-USB port and the 3.5mm audio jack
 are placed on the top panel. The back of the phone houses the 
5.0-megapixel camera module and LED flash. Both the camera and the flash
 are enclosed in a metallic rectangular frame. There's some more Coolpad
 branding along with the Spice logo in the middle, while the speaker 
grille is located towards the bottom. The Spice Coolpad Mi-515 is
 a dual-SIM (GSM + GSM) smartphone. Both SIM card slots and the slot for
 the microSD card hide behind the back cover, just above the battery 
slot. If one wants to change the SIM card, the device needs to be 
switched off, as the SIMs cannot be accessed without removing the 
battery. The body of the phone is plasticky and the device plain at best
 in terms of looks. The glossy back makes the phone slippery and 
difficult to grip. Having said that, the device did fit in our hands 
comfortably despite the 5.0-inch form factor. DisplayThe 
Spice Coolpad Mi-515 sports an IPS LCD 5.0-inch display with a 
resolution of 540x960 pixels that can be considered decent at this price
 range. Though, we would have loved an HD screen, a majority of handsets
 in the same segment feature similar screen resolution. The viewing 
angles seem to be fine. The screen was not very visible under the sun 
even with full brightness, as it's highly reflective. Viewing videos on 
Spice Coolpad Mi-515 was fun thanks to the 5.0-inch screen. Software/ InterfaceThe
 Spice Coolpad Mi-515 runs Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean) with some minor 
tweaks done by the company including skinning of app icons, colour 
schemes and settings toggles. It's not the latest version of the OS but 
almost all devices in this price segment feature the same operating 
system. In terms of additional functionality, the software has nothing 
new to offer. The home-screen panel consists of five customizable
 screens. The notification tray includes toggles for settings such as 
Wi-Fi, Brightness, Rotation, Bluetooth, GPS, Data, Screen timeout and 
sound profiles. The device comes with NQ anti-virus pre-loaded 
that helps safeguard the device from malware, viruses and similar 
threats with a free usage for a limited period. The phone also includes 
some preloaded apps that include Chrome, Facebook, Opera Mini, TOI, 
SpiceGang, Nimbuzz, WhatsApp and Twitter.The phone also comes with the ability to update the operating system over the air through a Wireless Update utility. CameraThe
 camera on the Spice Coolpad Mi-515 is a bit of let down. The 
5.0-megapixel camera takes decent quality shots during well-lit 
conditions but disappoints when it comes to low-light and indoor shots. 
The images shot in low-light had a lot of noise, lacked detail and were 
grainy.  Even photos clicked outdoors in bright light lack detail and 
the colour reproduction isn't accurate.The camera app on the 
device does not offer too much in terms of options. A few camera 
features included in the handset are an HDR mode, face-recognition, 
colour effects, scene modes, and anti-flicker. Many would not mind the 
absence of a physical camera key but it would have added to the comfort 
of using the camera on the device.Though the device supports HD video recording but we were not very impressed with the quality of the recorded videos.Spice
 Coolpad Mi-515 also includes a VGA front camera. However, the quality 
of the front camera was not that great and it can be used for 
self-portrait shots at best. Overall, the device is not that great in 
the camera department.PerformanceThe Spice Coolpad Mi-515 
is powered by a 1.2GHz quad-core processor, and has 1GB RAM. There is 
4GB of internal storage, which is expandable up to 32GB with the help of
 microSD card.We did not experience any lag while browsing the 
Web or navigating on the device, however, we did experience lag while 
launching and exiting games like Dead Trigger and Temple Run 2. The
 phone comes with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 3G, GPRS, EDGE, and Micro-USB 
connectivity options. Other major features include GPS, a-GPS. The phone
 also comes with FM Radio and offers good reception. It is 
powered by a 2000mAh battery that easily lasts for more than a day with 
normal usage, including calling, browsing, playing games and using apps.
 The touchscreen QWERTY keyboard of the device was a bit sloppy and it 
took some time to get used to it.We were able to play full-HD 
videos and the phone supported popular formats. The device doesn't offer
 much in terms of music playback. The sound quality was average through 
the supplied headset and the built-in speaker outlet. The call quality 
was good during our testing of the device.VerdictThe Spice
 Coolpad Mi-515 is a good option among large 5.0-inch budget phones. The
 phone scores more in terms of its battery back up, performance and the 
presence of a 5.0-inch screen. The camera performance on the other hand 
was just average. However, the whole package at Rs. 9,449 is not a bad 
deal.Those looking for alternatives can look at Karbonn Titanium 
S2 that also comes 
with a 1.2GHz quad-core processor and is priced at Rs. 10,200. The Intex
 Aqua Wonder, which is also not a bad option, 
available at a price point of Rs. 9,500. Looking beyond the Android 
world, Nokia Lumia 520 (Review |

is probably the best value for money offering in the sub-Rs. 10,000.Mobiles launched in July 2013Price: Rs. 9449
