Microsoft Lumia 532 Dual SIM Review: Up Against the Android Army

No matter which part of the 
market it tries to address, Microsoft will have stiff competition from 
multiple Android partners. At the high end, there's really no contest - 
Microsoft hasn't released a new flagship since it erased Nokia's name 
from the catalog, and it won't until Windows 10 is ready to go later 
this year. Lumia models stand out in the mid-range because of their 
attractive styling, good cameras and decent battery life, which somewhat
 make up for other shortcomings. Last year, Nokia had a fair bit 
of success with the 52x and 62x Lumia series, which were priced well and
 offered enough value. Now, the budget Android landscape has shifted 
dramatically in the wake of a Chinese invasion. Xiaomi, Lenovo, 
Motorola, Asus and many others have strong grips on the sub-Rs. 10,000 
market, so can Microsoft still carve out a niche?Look and feelThe
 Microsoft Lumia 532 Dual SIM is a bit of an ugly duckling. It's thick, 
chunky and not immediately appealing. In fact it looks a lot like the 
Asha series thanks to the obvious outer shell with squared off sides and
 pointy corners. Our review sample was black, which didn't help the 
phone look sleek, but it's also available in white, green, or orange. At
 least it isn't too heavy, at 136g.The rear has a matte finish 
for grip, but the sides are glossy. As expected, the shell pops right 
out and we can easily see that the phone could have been a lot less 
bulky without it. The corners dug into our palms and we noticed a lot of
 scuffing on the glossy plastic bits, which was a little disappointing.This
 is a plain budget phone, so don't expect more than the basics. There's a
 3.5mm headset socket on top and a Micro-USB port on the bottom. The 
power and volume buttons are on the right. There's a simple camera lens 
without a flash on the rear, and a speaker cutout below it. There is 
another camera on the front, above the screen.  A Microsoft logo 
replaces the familiar Nokia typography - we're still getting used to 
that.The battery feels relatively small, and you'll find the two 
Micro-SIM card holders and a microSD slot when you pop it out. The metal
 SIM card holders feel a little flimsy, but cards should stay secure as 
long as you don't swap them often.SpecificationsMicrosoft 
will find itself falling behind Android smartphones in this price range -
 the Lumia 532 Dual SIM feels like a phone that's several years old, and
 that's primarily due to the screen. At 4 inches diagonally, the 
480x800-pixel resolution means there are visible jagged edges and 
gradients are not smooth. It's also not a very high-quality screen - 
colours are dull, and lose definition as soon as you look at the screen 
from an angle. It gets bright enough, but is still difficult to use 
under direct sunlight.The processor is a rather anaemic Qualcomm 
Snapdragon 200, which has four 1.2GHz Cortex-A7 cores running at 1.2GHz,
 and Adreno 302 graphics. We expected the 1GB of RAM, but it was nice to
 see 8GB of storage space. Lumia phones usually support high-capacity 
microSD cards, and this one is no exception - you can add up to 128GB 
more space if needed. Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 and A-GPS are 
available, as is FM radio. You don't get many sensors, only an 
accelerometer and an ambient light sensor to manage auto brightness. The
 battery is rate at 1,560mAh which is incredibly disappointing. The 
cameras are also nothing to get excited about: a 5-megapixel one on the 
rear and a 0.3-megapixel VGA one in front. Video recording is limited to
 480p even with the rear camera. Microsoft includes a headset and a 
charger (with a fixed cable) in the box.SoftwareThe 
Microsoft Lumia 532 Dual SIM ships with the Denim update of Windows 
Phone 8.1 which brings a few interesting improvements to the OS. 
Notably, this phone comes with a large Cortana tile on the homescreen, 
though it won't work if your location is set to India. The app displays 
an apologetic message, but it's fairly easy to change to US English.You
 get a few handy in-house apps, most notably Here Maps and Here Drive+. 
There's also a separate Bing Maps app - Microsoft has not yet resolved 
all of Nokia's assets with its own. Lumia Camera is a great app, but is 
absolutely crippled by the lousy cameras on this device. Similarly, 
Lumia Cinemagraph, Lumia Selfie, Lumia Storyteller and Lumia Creative 
Studio won't be as useful on this phone as they are on others. MixRadio 
is still one of our favourite Lumia apps and has a fantastic library 
that you can stream tracks and create custom playlists from - sadly, the
 extremely cheap premium subscription plan is not available anymore.The
 rest of the Bing apps - Food & Drink, Health & Fitness, Money, 
News, Sport, etc are easy to ignore and surprisingly, can be 
uninstalled. Other tools, such as Podcasts and Wallet can't be removed. 
Beyond that, Microsoft seems to have gone overboard with the third-party
 apps. We found BlackBerry Messenger, Facebook, Foodpanda, Gameloft Hub,
 Jabong, Paytm, Redbus, Star Sports, Truecaller and Twitter - some 
useful, but most just spammy. In total, there's more software here than 
most phone's come with. At least one thing this does is show that
 there are plenty of apps for the Windows Phone platform now, especially
 the common ones that people might be upset about missing. Those who buy
 phones at this price level will probably not have huge problems with 
the selection available. Combined with other platform features such as 
the extremely handy Glance Screen notifications and Sense tools, the 
effect is that Windows Phone could be a viable alternative to Android 
with a unique look and useful features - and more importantly, no huge 
drawbacks.PerformanceAs expected, the weak hardware 
resulted in some pretty mediocre test scores. SunSpider took 1251.3ms 
and Mozilla Kraken took 26992.4ms, which are about the average for 
low-cost phones. AnTuTu for Windows Phone returned 11841 points and 
WPbench came up with 258.8 points, both of which are about the same as 
the Nokia Lumia 630 Dual SIM scored when we tested it a little while 
ago.Quite a few of our sample videos refused to play. The Lumia 
532 Dual SIM couldn't handle 720p files at all and was only just about 
able to play a 480p MOV file using a third-party app. The speaker did 
manage to get quite loud, though sound was muffled and thin.  Despite
 having a fixed-focus lens, the read camera is not entirely awful. 
Colour accuracy is off and there's no room for improvement by resizing 
them since they're already low-resolution - but there's a surprising 
amount of detail in most shots. Even low-light photos taken in 
reasonably well-lit spaces came out looking decent. That said, phones 
such as the Xiaomi Redmi 2 will still run rings around the Lumia 532 
Dual SIM in the camera department. Video was expectedly poor, and the 
front-facing camera is all but useless.The battery lasted 9 
hours, 4 minutes in our video loop test which was surprising, 
considering how small the battery is. It would seem that Microsoft has 
managed to tweak its software and hardware to sip power, which is a very
 good thing. Test scores aside, we did have some trouble while 
using this phone. On a few occasions, we picked it up only to find that 
it had turned itself off and was unresponsive. It only came back on 
after we popped the battery out each time. On another occasion, we left 
it lying on a table and turned away for a few minutes, during which the 
phone decided to install updates on its own. We were surprised to see an
 animation of spinning gears, and then a progress bar. The whole thing 
lasted nearly 10 minutes, during which time the phone was unusable. Both
 behaviours are worrying, because you won't know you're unreachable 
unless you keep looking at your phone.(Click to see full size)VerdictMicrosoft 
clearly cannot win in this budget segment on the basis of features and 
specifications alone. The company has therefore tried to create an 
experience around its Lumia hardware and Windows Phone software. The 
attempt works to some extent, but there are still a lot of things that 
Android does better, and not enough things that the Lumia 532 Dual SIM
