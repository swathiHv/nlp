Oppo Neo 5 (2015) Review: Underpowered and Overshadowed

Oppo made quite a splash 
when it debuted in India, being one of the first value-minded brands to 
compete with the likes of Samsung and Sony. Since then, things have 
slowed down a bit with newer launches from Xiaomi, Coolpad and other 
smaller Chinese brands stealing Oppo's thunder. Value charts have been 
rewritten countless times in the past year and we've now come to a point
 where some truly remarkable devices are available for less than Rs. 
10,000 - devices that would have cost twice as much not too long ago.The
 company's latest launch is the Oppo Neo 5 (2015), which replaces an 
older model also named Oppo Neo 5 but looks nothing like it. Priced at 
Rs. 9,990, it will have to fend off the horde of capable budget devices 
currently available in the market, several of which are priced 
significantly lower, at Rs. 5,999 or even less. This will be an 
interesting competition.Look and feelWhen we look at the 
Oppo Neo 5 (2015), we can't help but feel we've seen it before. That's 
because the design formula of a flat front and back with a metallic band
 around the sides has been done to death by multiple companies, all 
trying to ape the iconic iPhone 4/4S look. Lava's Iris Pro models, in 
particular, stand out as examples of this.Our review unit was 
made of white plastic with a dull gold band. The capacitive button icons
 below the screen and the rings around the camera lens and flash on the 
rear are also metallic, but for some reason, silver. The phone is tall 
and narrow, with quite a lot of white space above and below the screen 
but relatively thin borders on the sides. The only real flash of 
personality this phone has is the patterned speaker grille on the lower 
rear.The power button is on the left and the volume rocker on the
 right, which took some getting used to. There's only a 3.5mm audio jack
 on top and the Micro-USB port and a mic hole on the bottom. The rear 
panel is removable but the battery is sealed in - you'll find only one 
Micro-SIM slot, one Nano-SIM slot and a microSD slot.The 
construction quality of the phone as well as its bundled accessories 
seems good. In terms of grip, we definitely prefer curves over hard 
edges like the ones the Neo 5 (2015) has, and it dug into our palms with
 prolonged usage. The top edge also felt scratchy against our ears.Specifications and softwareConsidering
 its price, the Oppo Neo 5 (2015) comes across as a phone that's out of 
touch with the current market scenario. While 720p screens have become 
common at much lower price points, this phone has a lowly resolution of 
480x854, which translates to a density of just 218ppi at 4.5 inches 
diagonally. The difference is immediately apparent, and we were 
underwhelmed from the moment we turned this phone on. The 
processor is a MediaTek MT6582, which was quite common in last year's 
bargain-basement phones. It has four cores running at 1.3GHz, and 
integrated Mali-400MP2 graphics. The 1GB of RAM is also disappointing. 
8GB of storage is not too bad, but you can bump that up by only 32GB 
using a microSD card. Thankfully there's USB-OTG support. You 
also get Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, FM radio and A-GPS, but no 4G. 
There's an accelerometer, compass, ambient light sensor and proximity 
sensor. The non-removable battery is rated at 2,000mAh. The primary 
camera has an 8-megapixel sensor but is limited to 720p video recording,
 and the secondary camera comes in at 2 megapixels.Oppo's custom 
skin is called Color OS, and we've used it before. Unfortunately the Neo
 5 (2015) is still based on Android 4.4.2. You can choose from a handful
 of widgets, wallpapers, effects and themes, which give you some 
cosmetic control over the interface. The task switcher is called up by 
long-tapping the capacitive Menu button. Oppo bundles a Security Centre 
app that, despite its name, also includes a power manager, notifications
 disabler, data monitor and memory cleanup tool. Guest Mode lets 
you designate contacts, photos and apps that are hidden from prying 
eyes, and Permission Monitor lets you see what your apps are doing 
behind your back. We aren't really fans of Oppo's custom keyboard and 
icons, and the photos app felt sluggish. On the other hand, it was nice 
to have lots of quick toggles in the notifications shade, and the 
Settings app is neatly organised.Overall, the spec sheet reads 
like one we should have come across a year or more ago. The Oppo Neo 5 
(2015) is thoroughly outmatched by its competition today. It almost 
feels as though the company designed this model last year but only just 
found a few crates full of them sitting forgotten in a warehouse 
somewhere and decided to sell them anyway (we checked, though, and our 
review unit's date of manufacturing was June 2015). Oppo knows this but 
points to its camera quality and other intangible features that make up 
for it, which we will have to see for ourselves.PerformanceWe
 went into the benchmarking phase of our review with low expectations, 
and were not surprised by what we found. The Neo 5 (2015) seemed to do 
okay with day-to-day usage, but struggled with our tests indicating that
 heavy games and apps wouldn't run. If you like bouncing between lots of
 apps and browser tabs, you might run into bottlenecks that other phones
 in the market today do not face.Despite the low-resolution 
screen, graphics scores were terrible. The phone was only able to push 
out 9.6fps in GFXbench, and the scores of 3,228 and 2,090 respectively 
in 3DMark Ice Storm and Ice Storm Extreme were well below current 
averages. AnTuTu and Quadrant's scores came in at 18,703 and 7,269 
respectively. Contrary to Oppo's hopes, we were disappointed with
 the camera. Shots taken on a slightly cloudy day in Mumbai came out 
overexposed and full of noise. There was no pop to the colours we 
captured, and detailing and texture were completely lost. Things 
deteriorated even further when inspected at full size on a desktop 
monitor. Shots taken at night were completely unusable unless there was a
 lot of incident light. The flash worked to light subjects up, but 
robbed them of whatever little detail they might have had. We've seen a 
lot better from phones that cost a lot less.(Click to see full size)The Oppo Neo 5 (2015)
 had trouble with our heavier 1080p video files, but 720p ones played 
without artefacts or stuttering. The speaker on the back proved to be 
pretty loud and sound was clear at high volumes, though not very rich or
 warm. Battery life was the biggest silver lining to this phone's dark 
cloud; we were able to get a respectable 8 hours, 19 minutes of runtime 
in our video loop test. We were also pleased to see that the battery 
level didn't dip much when the phone was left idle. We'd expect users to
 get at least a full day out of each charge.VerdictIt is 
clear that this phone is overpriced and thus cannot hope to compete in 
terms of features and specifications alone. Therefore, we spent quite a 
bit of time looking for evidence of any redeeming factor, including the 
camera, which Oppo itself pointed out to us. Our findings show that it 
will take a lot to remain competitive in the low-cost smartphone market,
 and even those who disrupted the market at one time can have the carpet
 pulled out from under then. We'd advise anyone interested in 
this phone to do a quick scan of the market and compare prices, 
specifications and benchmark numbers. The Xiaomi Redmi 2 (Review | Pictures) Coolpad Dazen 1
 (Review | Pictures) and Lenovo A6000 Plus (Review | Pictures) are just a few of the lower-priced choices that 
perform just as well as or better than this phone. At the same price 
level, you could also consider the Infocus M330 (Review) and Lenovo K3 Note, or 
for just a little more there's the Motorola Moto G (Gen 2) (Review | Pictures).
