iOS 7: First impressions

One of the best things about Apple's latest iPhones is the slick new iOS
 7 software that runs the devices. But that souped-up operating system 
could end up hurting sales because the free software upgrade will also 
work on iPhones released since 2010, giving owners of the older models 
less incentive to buy Apple's newest products.Perhaps unwittingly, 
even Apple's software boss Craig Federighi alluded to this potential 
problem while he was bragging about iOS 7 at the company's unveiling of 
its new phones Tuesday. He predicted that anyone who elects to install 
the software will feel "like they're getting an all-new device."(Also see: Apple unveils iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s)I
 understood what Federighi meant once I was able to see the iOS 7's 
improvements in action on Apple's two new iPhones, the iPhone 5c and the iPhone 5s. 
Although Apple announced iOS 7 at a conference three months ago, Tuesday
 marked the first time the company allowed reporters to experience the 
software hands-on.Although the iPhone 5c is less expensive than 
its predecessor, the iPhone 5, iOS 7 almost made it look fancier than 
previous generations. As an iPhone 5 owner, I was feeling a bit envious 
until I remembered that I'll be able to spiff up my device, too, when 
the software is released on Sept. 18. The operating system will work on 
the iPhone 4 and later models, iPad 2s and subsequent versions, and the 
iPod Touch that came out late last year.iOS 7 looks much 
different than previous versions of the operating system because it no 
longer displays iPhone apps as three-dimensional, embossed objects meant
 to mirror their real-world counterparts. The icons instead are flatter 
and more colorful.Any significant change in design typically 
upsets users familiar with the old way of doing things, but I suspect 
the complaints about iOS 7 will be muted unless there are some terrible 
bugs in the software that weren't evident during the brief time that I 
was given to experiment.I am fairly certain most people who 
download iOS 7 are going to be pleased. The software makes it easier to 
navigate around an iPhone and adds some compelling new features.(Also see: 10 big improvements in Apple's iOS 7)The
 additions include the ability to stream music through an 
advertising-supported service called iTunes Radio and five free apps 
that used to cost consumers anywhere from 99 cents to $4.99 apiece. The 
free apps are Apple's photo-editing tool, iPhoto, and video-editing 
program, iMovie, as well as work-oriented apps called Pages, Numbers and
 Keynote.Apple doesn't appear to be removing any popular apps 
built into the operating system, as best as I could tell. The company 
did that last year when it replaced Google's mapping app with its own 
navigation system only to be ridiculed for misguiding users with shoddy 
directions. Apple isn't bringing back Google Maps with iOS 7, but it is 
promising that its alternative is getting better.The software 
upgrade also will make it easier to take better pictures on the iPhone 
and automatically sort photos into different categories to denote 
particular events. I particularly liked a feature that lets you control 
how the camera operates by toggling between options at the bottom of the
 screen with the swipe of a finger. Once the camera is open in IOS 7, 
the choices include taking a square, panoramic or standard photo. The 
bottom-of-the screen controls also include an option to switch to video 
mode.When taking a picture in iOS 7, photographers can also 
choose a filter to use as they snap the photo rather than waiting to 
touch up the shot later. When shooting video, shots can be zoomed in 
while recording. I can't do any of that on my iPhone 5 because it is 
still powered by iOS 6.The new system also empowers users to 
access other open apps more easily by clicking twice on the home button.
 When you do that, the apps are displayed as tiles that can be scrolled 
across horizontally so you can more easily see and choose several of 
them.Apple is also making it easier to access frequently used 
controls such as and airplane mode by enabling users to pull up the 
panel from the bottom of the display screen instead of finding and 
pressing a settings option.Other than the new software, the iPhone 5c isn't anything special, as one might expect from a cheaper phone.(Also see: iPhone 5c price disappointment: 'Low-cost iPhone' fails to check-in)The
 only thing that really distinguishes the 5c from the iPhone 5 is that 
it's housed in plastic instead of aluminum. Some consumers will no doubt
 like the plastic alternative because it comes in five colors: green, 
blue, yellow, pink and white. The price also may be more appealing, with
 the 5c starting at $99 with a two-year wireless contract, a $100 
discount from iPhone models released in previous years.A 
higher-end iPhone dubbed the 5s boasts several advantages that aren't 
available on any other model. The coolest innovation allows you to use 
your fingerprint to unlock the iPhone 5s instead of relying on a 
four-digit code that has to be repeatedly typed in. The fingerprint 
reader can also be used to access Apple's apps and iTunes store instead 
of a password.(Also see: 10 new features in Apple's iPhone 5s)Apple CEO Tim Cook thinks the fingerprint scanner 
will revolutionize technology security. "There is going to be a whole 
new generation of kids who grow up not knowing what a password is," Cook
 predicted during a brief discussion with a small group of reporters 
after he left the room where Apple was demonstrating its new iPhones.I
 found the fingerprint scanner, called "Touch ID," simple to use during 
my brief test of the 5s. It just took less than a minute for the phone 
to record the fingerprint on my thumb, instructing me along the way. 
Once my prints were in the phone's memory bank, all I had to do was 
lightly press on the home button when the 5s was locked in sleep mode 
and it quickly opened.The 5s also contains a faster processor and
 technological wizardry designed to take sharper pictures and even 
record slow-motion video.Best of all, though, the 5s comes with 
the iOS 7. I am already looking forward to downloading the software next
 week so I can simulate what it's like to have a new iPhone for free.(Also see: Apple says iOS 7 will be available September 18) iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s launch in pictures
