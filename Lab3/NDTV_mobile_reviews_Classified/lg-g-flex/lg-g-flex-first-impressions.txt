LG G Flex: First impressions

LG finally introduced its first curved display smartphone in India, the G Flex, at an event in New Delhi. Indian consumers 
will have to wait till next year to get their hands on the device, as the
 G Flex will be available in India only in February 2014.We got a chance to play with the LG G Flex at the event however, and sum up our first impressions below.When
 we first held the G Flex in our hands, we were definitely a bit taken aback by 
its ergonomic curved design, which definitely is the device's USP. The G
 Flex is curved on its horizontal axis which gives the device's top and 
bottom edges a curl shape. The biggest perceived advantage of the G Flex's curve in our 
limited period usage, is while talking on the device - the 
design definitely better hugs your face, much like an old landline phone. In 
terms of gripping, the curve also helps to comfortably hold the device, but the rear 
is made of plastic, so it can also slip out during long usage. When compared to some of its close competitors like HTC One Max and the 
Galaxy Mega 6.3, the G Flex (160.5x81.6x8.7mm) is better to hold and 
move around thanks to the curve design. Next big thing which is very much noticeable in the G
 Flex is its size, the 6-inch display does puts it in the phablet 
category and does looks like a large device in hands. Notably, we were unable to easily
use the G Flex with one hand, as we found it difficult to stretch 
our thumb across the device. When talking about phablets, we still 
believe that Samsung's Galaxy Note 3 (151.2x79.2x8.3mm) and Sony's 
Xperia Z Ultra (179.4x92.2x6.5mm) were better in terms of daily usage 
because of a more lightweight and sleeker profile.At the event, we were 
told that the G Flex can actually 'flex' until it's totally flat, and 
one of the company representatives even claimed that the South Korean 
manufacturer has tested the flexibility of the G Flex up to 100 times 
with about 40 kilograms of weight putting on the device without damaging
 the G Flex's screen.  Let's say in the case, when accidentally sitting 
on the G Flex. While we couldn't test it with 40 kilograms of weight, 
we did press the curve of the G Flex, and it did stretch to be 
flat. While the display didn't crack, it's not really advisable to do this on a 
daily basis.Following 
closely on the lines of LG's current flagship smartphone, the LG G2, G 
Flex also features rear physical keys for power and volume controls. LG 
has equipped the LED light on the rear power key which comes handy for 
notifications and while taking a selfie. The keys are metallic and offer 
good tactile feedback, very much like the LG G2. The volume-up button 
also doubles up as a shortcut key to launch the Quickmemo app on long 
press and the volume-down button acts as a camera shortcut key on long 
press when the phone is locked.The G Flex also includes a number 
of ports around the edges including the 3.5mm audio jack and the 
charging port that sits at the bottom panel, while the micro-SIM card slot sits at the left panel of the G Flex. The rear panel includes the 
primary 13-megapixel camera with an LED flash, which is accompanied by an IR 
Blaster.It would be unfair to end the design part without talking
 about G Flex's self-healing back that has been creating a buzz 
worldwide. When we wanted to test the self-healing capability of the G Flex, we
 were sure we needed a scratchy material; unfortunately we didn't carry a
 knife so we tried our key chain to rub the rear panel and gave it a 
surface level scratch which was very much visible initially. After 
some time, we noticed that the scratches were reduced but not completely 
eliminated. While looking the G Flex from a certain angle, it looked 
that the scratches were gone, although it was pretty much noticeable. 
However, we must confess we were impressed and believe that the G Flex 
can easily handle day-to-day bruises.  Coming to the hardware of 
the G Flex, it is powered by a quad-core 2.26GHz Snapdragon 800 (MSM8974) 
processor with an Adreno 330 GPU, and 2GB of RAM. The G Flex easily 
handled multitasking with ease, and the apps opened and closed 
instantaneously. Performance wise, the G Flex fared well in our limited 
testing.   The G Flex sports a 13-megapixel rear camera, and a 
2.1-megapixel front-facing camera. During our usage, the camera app 
opened instantly and did click at good speed without any shutter lag. 
The G Flex is powered by a 3,500mAh battery and weighs 177 grams. The LG
 G Flex comes with 32GB inbuilt storage, which is non-expandable.The
 LG G Flex runs Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, which is a disappointment as 
we expected LG to ship Android 4.3, the most recent iteration of the OS 
with the phone. However, with LG finally revealing plans for rolling out
 the Android 4.4 KitKat update 
for the flagship smartphone, the G2, we expect 
that the G Flex will also get the KitKat treatment soon.On the software 
department, the G Flex borrows many things from the G2. The company has 
added the same LG G2 UI layer on top of the G Flex, majorly changing the
 look and feel of the interface and enabling users to customise the 
phone according to their liking.The LG G Flex also features the 
KnockON, which is LG's version of double tap to unlock and even lock the
 smartphone. In our limited testing, we found that at times while trying
 to unlock the phone it didn't register our taps. In fact, it was 
annoying at times. Other features on the G Flex include Slide Aside 
which is a way to multitask by moving between three apps at once via a 
three-finger swipe gesture; Guest mode, which allows you to create a 
guest mode with pre-selected apps for times when your friends or family 
want to use your phone; Dual Window, which divides the screen into two 
panels for multitasking and QuickTheatre that gives direct access to 
gallery, videos and YouTube icons.You can expect more detailed observations and testing when we review the LG G Flex.
