BlackBerry Z10 is a good stab at rebirth

Are you ashamed to have a BlackBerry? It's not exactly a status symbol 
any more, at least not in the U.S., after it got left in the dust by the
 iPhone. Now, there's a new BlackBerry that wants to get back into the 
cool club the Z10.It's the first phone to run the new BlackBerry 10 
operating system, and it is, at first blush, a very good stab at 
regaining at least some of the cachet of the BlackBerry.The 
problem is that no one has ever succeeded in turning around a failing 
smartphone maker. Remember the Palm, anyone? It's simply a brutal 
industry. So even if the Z10 does everything it set out to do, it might 
not be enough to save Research In Motion Ltd., the home of the 
BlackBerry. The company is changing its name to BlackBerry, but that 
could just be the prelude to riding the brand into the sunset once and 
for all.It doesn't exactly help that the Z10 looks like every 
other smartphone on the shelf. It's a flat black slab with a touch 
screen, nearly indistinguishable at 15 feet from the iPhone 5 or a bevy 
of Android smartphones. The screen measures 4.2 inches diagonally, a bit
 bigger than the iPhone but smaller than most Android phones. It will go
 on sale in the U.S. in March, probably for about $200 with a two-year 
service contract, in line with the iPhone and other rivals.Turn 
it on, and the differences become more evident. Older BlackBerrys are 
great communications devices, but are poor at multimedia and at running 
third-party apps, something the iPhone excels at. The new BlackBerry 10 
software is a serious attempt at marrying these two feature sets, and 
after a few hours of use, it looks like it succeeds.BlackBerry 10
 was delayed for about a year, and it seems as if the extra time was put
 to good use. The software is, for a first release, uncommonly slick and
 well thought out, completely unlike the PlayBook disaster of two years 
ago, when RIM released a tablet computer that couldn't do email.The
 Z10 is easier to use than an Android phone. It is more difficult to use
 than the iPhone, but it is also more powerful, giving you faster access
 to your email, tweets, Facebook status updates and text messages.These
 communications end up in the "Hub," a window that slides in from the 
left side of the screen. Whatever you're doing on the phone, you can get
 to the hub with a single swipe on the screen, and then go back. It's a 
great feature for the always-connected.The software is good for 
on-the-go types as well, because it's designed for one-handed use. While
 texting, you'll have one hand free for holding your bag or pushing open
 doors.It's also completely touch-oriented, which isn't what 
you'd expect from a BlackBerry. You don't use a hardware buttons to 
navigate the phone at all: They're just to turn the phone on or off, or 
adjust the volume. To get around, you swipe across the screen. Up, down,
 right and left swipes all do different things, but they're fairly easy 
to remember. Sadly, it's reminiscent of webOS, the last hurrah of 
smartphone pioneer Palm Inc. It was a great, swipe-based interface that 
never found an audience and was ultimately put to rest.Very 
rarely does BlackBerry 10 display a "Back" button on the screen, which 
is a blessing. I find Android's always-present "Back" button a huge 
annoyance, since it's rarely clear where it will take me. Will it take 
me back one screen or kick me out of the application I'm in? Only one 
way to find out: pushing it.BlackBerry diehards will lament the 
lack of a physical keyboard - they'll have to wait for the Q10, a model 
in the more traditional BlackBerry form. That's due this spring. But 
before writing off the Z10, these loyalists should try its on-screen 
keyboard. It's really very good. It provides more vertical space between
 the keys, imitating the steel bands that separated the hardware keys on
 the BlackBerry Bold. It's very accurate and easy to use.The Z10 
will also have a replaceable battery, something lacking on the iPhone. 
Screen quality will be good, too, at 356 pixels per inch, compared with 
326 for the iPhone 5 and 306 for Samsung's Galaxy S III. Unlike the 
iPhone, the Z10 will allow you to expand storage with a microSD card, 
and it sports a chip letting the phone act as a credit card at some 
payment terminals and share data wirelessly when tapped against some 
other phones. The Z10 is heavier than the iPhone, though - at 4.78 
ounces to the iPhone 5's 3.95 ounces.So why does the Z10 and BlackBerry 10 face such an uphill battle?Well,
 the library of third-party applications is the biggest reason. The 
iPhone and Android have a huge head start when it comes to getting 
developers to make applications that run on their phones. RIM says 
BlackBerry 10 will launch in the U.S. with about 100,000 apps. That 
sounds like a big number, and it includes important apps such as Skype 
and Facebook.But it's inevitable that the iPhone will have apps 
you want but can't get on BlackBerry 10. There's no Instagram, no 
Netflix. It's also obvious that the number includes some apps that were 
written for the PlayBook tablet and don't work well on the smaller phone
 screen.But the biggest obstacle to a RIM comeback is simply that
 the iPhone and Android have become the default for phone buyers, and 
few will see a reason to try something else. Microsoft, which has vastly
 more resources than RIM, has tried for two years to get people to buy 
Windows Phones, with very little to show for it.BlackBerry 10 is 
nice, but I can't point to anything about it that would make me say: 
"Forget those other phones: you have to buy this one." BlackBerry 10 Launch: In pictures
