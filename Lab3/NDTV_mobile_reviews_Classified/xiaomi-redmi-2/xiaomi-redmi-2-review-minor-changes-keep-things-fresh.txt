Xiaomi Redmi 2 Review: Minor Changes Keep Things Fresh

Xiaomi 
certainly has ambitions beyond the low end of the Indian market, but its
 bread and butter so far has been the sub-Rs. 10,000 segment. The launch
 of the outrageously powerful Redmi 1S was perhaps the most disruptive 
event in the entire Indian mobile market in all of 2014, and even with 
competitors coming in, there has been no shortage of demand. Hundreds of
 thousands of units were sold before the model abruptly disappeared from
 the scene, and it still commands almost full price when sold second-hand.The
 disappearance of the Xiaomi Redmi 1S (Review | Pictures) left a massive hole in the market,
 which the company is now trying to fill with its successor, the brand 
new Xiaomi Redmi 2. It will cost Rs. 1,000 more than the Redmi 1S did 
when it goes on sale each week for the foreseeable future but has a few 
features to make up for that. We're keen to see how much of a difference
 this generation leap actually makes, and whether Xiaomi can keep its 
momentum against a backdrop of dead serious new competitors.Look and feelThere
 isn't much differentiating the Redmi 2 from the Redmi 1S. Both are 
roughly the same size and have the same proportions. A glance at their 
respective spec sheets tells us that the Redmi 2 is slightly smaller and
 lighter, but this will hardly be perceptible to anyone. The phone is 
very comfortable to hold and we had no problem using it with one hand.Xiaomi
 has launched the Redmi 2 with a white rear shell which gives it a 
strong family resemblance to the Redmi Note  twins. This model's rear 
shell, however, has a pleasant soft texture rather than shiny hard 
plastic. Smudges and scuffs will be very visible, and it's possible that
 it will get discoloured over time so a protective case would be a good 
investment.The overall look is pretty staid, which is not a bad 
thing. The front face is quite blank, though there's a tiny bit of flair
 to icons for the capacitive buttons below the screen, which are printed
 in red. These are difficult to locate in the dark but become highly 
reflective under the sun. There is a notification LED, but it's hidden 
below the Home button and is only visible when you have an alert or when
 the phone is charging.The rear is also quite plain, except for a
 very noticeable silver Mi logo. The camera lens is slightly raised, and
 the flash, speaker grille and secondary mic are arranged around it. The
 power and volume buttons are on the right, the 3.5mm headset socket is 
on top, and the Micro-USB port is on the bottom. Xiaomi continues to use
 a rectangular port cutout which makes it difficult to orient Micro-USB 
cables - no reversible Type-C connector yet, unfortunately!Beneath
 the cover, you'll see the large orange battery pack, the two Micro-SIM
 card slots and the microSD slot. The battery is removable and in fact 
you will have to pop it out to insert or swap SIM cards. Specifications and softwareThink
 of the Xiaomi Redmi 2 as the Redmi 1S with a few things freshened up. 
There's a 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 SoC in place of last year's 
1.6GHz Snapdragon 400. The clock speed might be lower, but the four CPU 
cores are more modern and more powerful. The integrated GPU is also the 
more recent Adreno 306 compared to the Adreno 305.There's still 
1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage space though a more expensive limited 
edition with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage might be available later. 
The screen measures 4.7 inches diagonally and its resolution of 720x1280
 is one of the main features that sets this phone apart in the budget 
segment. Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, A-GPS and FM radio are standard. 
The rear camera still has an 8-megapixel sensor but the front one gets 
an upgrade to 2 megapixels from 1.6. The battery has also received a 
nice bump up from 2,000mAh to 2,200mAh. Of course one of the 
biggest new features is support for LTE on both SIM cards. While 
undoubtedly welcome, this is not going to be a huge sales motivator. LTE
 is unlikely to become widespread and affordable before this phone is 
obsolete, and so we would actually have liked to see a less expensive 
version without it. If the Redmi 1S was still available for Rs. 1,000 
less, LTE alone would not convince a lot of people to buy the Redmi 2. Xiaomi's
 custom MIUI 6 skin is installed on top of Android 4.4.4. It's a little 
slicker than version 5, which came on the Redmi 1S. Like nearly all 
Chinese manufacturers' skins, this one dumps the Android app drawer and 
makes all icons and widgets live on the homescreens. Some of the little 
touches we liked in particular were the pocket-dial prevention mode, 
easy exposure level adjustment in the camera app, notification LED 
customisations, configurable shortcuts for all buttons, and high-quality
 themes.Fleksy and Swiftkey are preloaded and you can choose 
either over the standard Google keyboard when first setting up the 
phone. The Facebook, WPS Office, and Flipkart apps are preloaded, all of 
which are at least somewhat useful.  However, there are also some 
strange design touches to MIUI, such as burying commonly used settings 
in multiple menu layers, and making the quick settings panel harder to 
access.PerformanceDespite its slick looks, this is 
definitely a low-cost phone and you won't be able to suspend disbelief 
of that fact after spending some time with it. Things are a bit slow and
 there is a small amount of lag when launching and quitting apps, using 
the task switcher, and even within simple apps such as Google Play. 
Swipes registered as taps quite often. We even occasionally saw a load 
screen when quitting apps, telling us it would take a second or two for 
the main menu to show up. Benchmark test results were consistent 
with our expectations. The phone managed to pull in 20,550 and 10,616 
points in AnTuTu and Quadrant respectively. The graphics-heavy 3DMark 
Ice Storm Extreme and GFXbench tests gave us scores of 2,634 points and 
9.5fps respectively. All of these are consistent with the Redmi 1S's 
scores and do not amount to any major generational leap between the two.Call
 quality was reasonable, and very questionably, all calls are recorded 
by default. You'll find a way to turn this off in the settings app. 
Maybe if it wasn't on by default not many people would know such a 
feature was built in, but we would have preferred a pop-up asking us for
 permission first.Update: Xiaomi contacted us to say that call recording is not supposed to be on by default. Upon repeating our tests, we found that it was possible and far too easy to trigger an in-call record button, which was happening repeatedly. (Click to see full size)Camera quality is almost consistently great, 
but there were still problems. It took a while to autofocus and we soon 
began automatically just tapping to focus to avoid waiting. More 
importantly, almost all the photos we took had a very noticeable warm 
tinge, almost like a creative filter was permanently activated. While 
colours were not accurate, we were happy to see that detail levels were 
high and there wasn't much noise in daytime shots. The camera app offers
 a Manual mode which only adds controls for ISO and white balance. Video
 recorded with the rear camera was decent.(Click to see full size)The Redmi 2's battery 
is one of its strongest features. The new processor might not offer much
 in terms of speed gains, but it seems to have really optimised power 
consumption, because we were able to run our video loop test for a very 
impressive 12 hours, 18 minutes before this phone finally died. This is a
 huge improvement over the Redmi 1S. VerdictThe Xiaomi 
Redmi 2 replaces the Redmi 1S, one of the most popular phones of the 
past year, but at a higher price point. It is more polished in some ways
 but does not really raise the bar in terms of value for money. LTE is a
 huge feature, but has extremely limited relevance in India and is not 
something we would pay Rs. 1,000 more for at this point in time, given 
the choice. In that sense this phone is somewhat overshadowed by its 
predecessor. Nobody with a Redmi 1S should need to feel any urge 
to upgrade. Those who want the best possible phone at this price point 
would do well to consider the Motorola Moto E (Gen 2) (Review | Pictures) and Lenovo A6000 (Review | Pictures), 
both of which offer comparable features. Ultimately, the Xiaomi Redmi 2 
has the best-looking spec sheet of the trio, but the new Moto E has the 
advantages of its brand value and the fact that you can order one 
without the aggravation of flash sales.  Xiaomi Redmi 2 in pictures
