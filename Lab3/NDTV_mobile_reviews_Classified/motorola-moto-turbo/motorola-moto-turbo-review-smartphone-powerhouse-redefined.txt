Motorola Moto Turbo Review: Smartphone Powerhouse Redefined

If
 there is one smartphone company that has made a great comeback after facing
 near-total defeat, it has to be Motorola. The brand has come a long way
 since it reinvented itself with the Moto X (Review | Pictures) in the second half of 2013.In India, Motorola now has models that cater to every 
budget. Are you looking for a budget smartphone? You have 
the stellar Moto E (Gen 2) [Review | Pictures]. Do you want a phone that costs no more than Rs. 15,000 yet
offers stellar performance? Look no further than the Moto G (Gen 
2) [Review | Pictures]. Do you want a premium smartphone that costs less than most flagships in the
 market today? The Moto X (Gen 2) [Review | Pictures] fits the bill perfectly. With 
the launch of the Motorola Moto Turbo, the company has gone one step 
further than the Moto X (Gen 2) and created a smartphone that boasts of a
 stellar set of specifications. It also uses an interesting new material
 in its build. We are more than intrigued by what Motorola has on offer.
 Let's get down to brass tacks. Look and feelIt feels
 as though companies have given up on trying to improve the candybar design of 
smartphones, so we really appreciate those that introduce some sort of 
distinction - like Motorola, and its parent company Lenovo. The company 
introduced its Moto Maker customisation tool with the Moto X, and later
 took it to another level when it announced the Moto X (Gen 2). 
Unfortunately, the tool never made it to India. 
Even so, the rate at which Motorola has been coming up with innovative materials, designs and textures on its smartphones is worthy of applause. From the distinctive chin on the original Moto X to the
 bamboo back of the Moto X (Gen 2), Motorola has managed to 
distinguish itself. With
 the Moto Turbo, Motorola introduces a new material - ballistic nylon - 
which is essentially a thicker, tougher variant of synthetic nylon. 
Quick trivia: ballistic nylon was used in the flak jackets worn by 
World War II soldiers. The criss-cross black thread runs across 
the rear of the phone, which looks elegant to say the least. The 
trademark dimple with the Motorola logo has been replaced by a metal 
plate on the Moto Turbo. The primary camera is above this 
metal plate, flanked by two LED flash modules. The
 front of the device is quite ordinary, at least when compared to the
 design of the rear. A metal frame runs around the edges of the screen 
and the phone has a small chin on the lower front. Below 
the screen, Motorola has used capacitive buttons, which is 
odd considering most of its other phones use on-screen buttons. 
Considering this phone runs Android Lollipop, the KitKat-style icons look out-of-place. A single slit of 
a speaker curves across the plastic above the display, with a 
front-facing camera in between. The Micro-USB port can be found on 
the bottom of the phone whereas the 3.5mm audio jack is on the 
top. Thanks to its large battery, the phone is a fairly 
thick 11.2mm. Moreover, the weight of 166g is on the 
heavier side when compared to other flagship smartphones. Thankfully, 
the sides of the phone are only 8.3mm thick and it slopes gently to its 
thickest point. This makes handling the phone
 that much easier, though we still think that the smaller bezels on 
the Moto X (Gen 2) are more ergonomic. The 
volume rocker and the power button are both on the right edge of
 the phone. Interestingly, the Nano-SIM tray is attached to the volume 
rocker using a mechanism with springs. At first, this seems like an ingenious piece of design but 
in case a user fidgets too much and damages the tray, the SIM card and volume controls will both be lost.Just like the Moto X (Gen 2), the Moto Turbo sports a 
5.2-inch Super AMOLED screen with Corning's Gorilla Glass 3 for 
protection from scratches. The only difference here is the Moto Turbo 
has a resolution of 1440x2560 pixels (QHD), which translates to a
 whopping pixel density of 565ppi. This is one of the crispest screens 
we've seen on a phone, and spotting pixels is impossible. Being an AMOLED screen, the colours do tend to pop but not as 
much as the screen on the Moto X (Gen 2). Also, there is a weird yellow 
cast which is visible when viewed from an angle. We 
noticed that the screen doesn't get as bright as we'd have liked it to get, but thankfully the sunlight legibility is not affected. 
Motorola also adds a unique water-repellant nano-coating to the Moto 
Turbo which can protect it from liquid spills.Specifications and softwareQuite
 expectedly, Motorola has gone with premium components inside the Moto Turbo.
It rocks a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 SoC with a quad-core 
processor clocked at 2.7GHz and an Adreno 420 GPU. There is an ample 3GB
of RAM, and Motorola has launched the phone with 
64GB of internal storage, which should be enough for 
most practical purposes. In any case, there is no microSD card 
slot to increase storage capacity. The Moto Turbo's camera has a 21-megapixel Sony sensor, which is thought to be the same type used by Sony
 Xperia Z series of smartphones. This camera can also capture UHD 4K 
videos. Compared to the competition, the Moto Turbo has a fairly basic 
2-megapixel front facing camera which can also do 1080p videos. 
Connectivity-wise, the one Nano-SIM you can use will work with 4G networks 
but only on the 1800MHz band. Most 4G networks in India at the 
moment use the 2300MHz band, which the Moto 
Turbo cannot connect to. Other options for connectivity are Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac and NFC. The battery has a 
rated capacity of 3900mAh. The phone runs Android 5.0.2 Lollipop 
and includes all the cool additional features that we saw in the Moto X 
(Gen 2). Moto Voice is always listening and
 waiting for a command, and it works flawlessly most of the time. 
Moto Assist and Alert continue to be great additions too. Just like the 
Moto X (Gen 2), users can flick their wrists to open the camera app. The
 only missing feature is Spotlight Stories, which is no loss. CameraThe default camera app is meant for users who
 just want a simple and intuitive app that can capture pictures without 
any fuss. Users who want more manual functions will have to install a 
third-party alternative from the Play Store. (Click for full size)The 21-megapixel 
f/2.0 camera on the Moto Turbo is hampered by poor imaging processing 
software. The images we captured in bright daylight had well saturated 
colours and a good sense of depth. The camera also managed to 
minimise barrel distortion. However, we noticed that details in 
certain shots weren't defined really well. For example, in one of our 
shots the outlines of leaves merged into each other, despite focussing on
 that area. The HDR mode is not very effective and the lens couldn't do 
much to capture the wide range of light we were trying to deal with. We noticed some 
noise in shots taken in low light, but they weren't too bad overall. The camera can shoot 4K video and
 we suggest you stick to this resolution because our captured 1080p 
videos didn't look so good. It can also shoot slow-motion 60fps 720p videos, which looked average at best. The 2-megapixel front camera can 
take decent shots but don't expect it to be as good as some phones which are optimised for selfies.(Click for full size)PerformanceWe just want to
 use one word to describe this phone: powerhouse. The Moto Turbo 
just screamed through anything we threw at it. Games ran exceptionally 
well and general performance was really good in the course of our testing period. In
the AnTuTu benchmark test, the Moto Turbo scored 52,686 points which is
 the highest we've seen on a smartphone so far. In a weird recurrence, 
similar to our experience with the Motorola Google Nexus 6, we noticed that the 
Quadrant benchmark scores were much, much lower for such a 
capable SoC. The QHD resolution of 
the screen throttled our graphics benchmark numbers, but they were 
still pretty good. In 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited and GFXbench, the phone returned very high scores of 23,753 points and 26fps respectively. The 
phone played all our sample test videos without any hiccups. The 
loudspeaker doesn't get too loud but it sounds pretty tight even at high
 volumes. Unfortunately, this is only a mono speaker and that might not 
go down well with some buyers. The bundled headset looks like Apple's 
EarPods, the only difference being this one is black. It 
has a bass-heavy sound signature but isn't too bad. Thanks to 
the use of noise-cancelling microphones, the sound quality in calls is 
top notch and we really don't have any reason to complain about it. We
 ran our regular video loop battery test and the phone lasted 13 hours
 and 50 minutes before it needed a charge. This is quite a good result 
but it is nowhere close to the Sony Xperia Z3 (Review | Pictures) or the Xperia Z3 Compact's (Review | Pictures) 
performance. Motorola provides a fast charger in the box, 
which is great, but for some reason the phone started heating up 
while being charged.VerdictThe Motorola Moto Turbo is 
available for Rs. 41,999 exclusively on Flipkart. It might look like the
 pricing is on the higher side but the build quality and the overall 
performance of the phone are both really good. Competing flagship Android phones such as the Nexus 6 (Review | Pictures), Sony Xperia Z3, 
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (Review | Pictures), and the HTC One (M8) [Review | Pictures] each have their own pros and cons. We would have wholeheartedly 
recommended the Moto Turbo if the camera performance was better. Pick this phone only if you don't care too much about taking photographs. All 
said and done, Motorola needs to find a way to deal with its Achilles heel, and then it will be able to unleash a truly unstoppable force.
