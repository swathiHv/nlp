Motorola Moto Turbo First Impressions: The Big Daddy of the Motorola Lineup

Although Motorola is more focused on the new Moto E (Gen 2) right now, we 
couldn't help but feel a little more excited about the second phone on 
display at a recent Motorola event. The Motorola Moto Turbo will be the company's flagship 
smartphone once it launches, and one look at the spec sheet has
 us convinced. In fact, it will even give some of 
the more popular smartphone manufacturers a reason to worry, thanks to 
its stunning feature list.We reported earlier this week that Flipkart
 had already opened pre-orders for the Motorola Moto Turbo
 at Rs. 41,999, with a tentative launch scheduled for the third week of 
March. At its press event on Wednesday, Motorola gave us a teaser of the Moto 
Turbo, and we managed to score some hands-on time with it.There's a clear effort in the design
 to set the Turbo apart from the aesthetically similar Moto X, Moto G 
and Moto E. Lines and angles are sharper, with much less curvature to the 
shape of the device. It looks and feels more like the unsuccessful Razr 
series of 2013. There's a fair amount of bezel space around the 
display, and some of the bottom frontage has been used on the three 
Android keys. This is unusual in our opinion, 
because most phones are now leaning towards using soft keys on screen to save space and look better.The
 Motorola Moto Turbo is slim at the edges, but thanks to the curved 
back, it doesn't quite maintain that slimness throughout. At its 
thickest point, it measures about 10mm, but the shape and feel of 
the device make this less significant it sounds. It's 
comfortable to hold and doesn't feel too big at all.The back 
panel of the unit we used had a texture that Motorola calls 
'ballistic nylon'. It is supposed to offer above-average durability, but
 we can't comment on that just yet. It does feel grippy and good to 
hold, and the second Kevlar-based texture is supposed to be even better.
 The metal bodies of the HTC One series still feel like they're the 
best-built phones around, but the Moto Turbo is a close second.The
 display of the device is an excellent 5.2-inch 2560x1440 pixel Amoled 
affair, which has a very high 565ppi density. Images were
 sharp and bright, and there was absolutely nothing we could find wrong 
with the display. Even the slight warmth that was noticeable in the Moto
 X (Gen 2) was absent. The screen produces a clean, crisp and 
colour-neutral image every time.As expected, the Moto Turbo runs 
on Android Lollipop 5.0.2. Motorola has so far been quick with rolling out updates, 
and we expect that the Turbo's update schedule will be no different.The
 primary camera of the Motorola Moto Turbo has a Sony-built 21-megapixel 
sensor, and we were impressed with image quality at first glance. Focusing 
is quick, while colours seem fresh and realistic. This sensor has 
enjoyed some success on Sony's Xperia series of smartphones, and we have
 high expectations from it.We have mixed opinions about the use of the 
Snapdragon 805 SoC. Although an immensely capable processor, other current-generation flagships are based on the Snapdragon 810. When compared with
 the upcoming HTC One M9 and 
Samsung Galaxy S6, this
might turn out to be a weakness. Internal storage according to Flipkart's Moto Turbo page
 will be 64GB for the devices sold in India, while RAM is a suitably 
high 3GB.One of the biggest coups that Motorola has managed to pull off with the Moto Turbo is its giant 3,900mAh battery. This is a fair bit larger than the 3,220mAh unit on the 
Turbo's cousin, the Motorola Google Nexus 6, and completely dwarfs the 2,840mAh unit on the HTC One M9. Granted, a QHD display 
needs a lot more power to keep it going, but we expect this battery to 
easily power the smartphone through a day and a half of typical usage, 
if not more. At Rs. 41,999, this phone will be much less expensive than a 
lot of upcoming flagship devices. It's also cheaper than the 
Motorola Google Nexus 6, with pretty much the same specifications 
except for the smaller screen. We expect that the more convenient 
5.2-inch screen size will even tempt away some potential Nexus 6 customers, 
especially since both devices have similar stock-Android UIs and are on
 the ball with updates. We're optimistic about the potential of
 the Motorola Moto Turbo, and look forward to bringing a full review to 
you soon.
