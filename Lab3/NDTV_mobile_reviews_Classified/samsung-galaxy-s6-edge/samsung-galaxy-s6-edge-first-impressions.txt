Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+: First Impressions

Almost six months after the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, the 
company has launched a bigger, upgraded version, the Samsung Galaxy S6 
Edge+. The announcement, which comes within a week of the device's 
global launch indicates that Samsung considers India an important market for its 
high-end smartphones.Interestingly, Samsung did not launch the Galaxy
 Note 5 along with the Galaxy S6 Edge+ in India. The Galaxy S6 Edge is 
not all that old, but the Galaxy Note series hasn't had an update since 
the Galaxy Note 4 launched last year. When asked why, Asim Warsi, Vice 
President, Marketing, Mobile and IT, Samsung India dodged our question 
and only said "We will meet on a separate day to talk about the Samsung 
Galaxy Note 5."Coming back to Samsung's latest smartphone launch,
 the real question here is what it offers over and above its 
predecessor. On paper, the Galaxy S6 Edge+ features a larger display, 
more RAM, and a bigger battery than the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge (Review |
 Pictures) other than some minor changes. We spent some time with the 
Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ at the event, and while we will reserve our 
formal verdict until we can conduct a full review, here are our initial 
thoughts about the new smartphone.DesignFrom a distance, 
the Galaxy S6 Edge+ looks identical to the Galaxy S6 Edge. However, it 
is slightly thinner at 6.9mm while its predecessor measured 7mm. In the 
real world, no one will notice this tiny difference. The smartphone also
 features a 5.7-inch screen compared to the 5.1-inch seen on the Galaxy 
S6 Edge.Much like the Galaxy S6 Edge, the new Galaxy S6 Edge+ 
stands out from the crowd because of its screen, which curves around 
both sides of the phone. It will be available in Gold Platinum and 
Silver Titanium colour variants in India. We spent some time with a Gold
 Platinum unit during the launch event.The front and rear panels 
of the Galaxy S6 Edge+ are all glass. You can see the body colour 
through the rear glass, which is highly reflective. The camera bulges 
out slightly, like it does on many other Samsung models. The phone was 
bit hard to grip, mainly because of its thin sides, something we pointed
 out in our Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge review 
as well. Despite being heavier than its predecessor, the Galaxy S6 
Edge+ feels light at 153 grams.Below the screen, one can find the
 physical home button with an integrated fingerprint scanner which 
worked fine during our limited time with the device. However, one thing 
that disappoints us is that Samsung is yet to confirm whether the 
Samsung Pay payment service will come to the Indian market or not. 
Considering that Apple is yet to introduce Apple Pay, Samsung could gain
 an advantage over its biggest rival in bringing this feature to the 
country first. Warsi however said that the company is yet to finalise anything about it.Placed on either side of the physical 
home button are the capacitive Recent and Back buttons which light up 
only when touched. The power and volume buttons are housed on the right 
and left sides of the phone respectively. Similar to its predecessor, 
the Galaxy S6 Edge+ features a Nano-SIM card tray on the top, while the 
speaker grille and 3.5mm audio jack are on the bottom, alongside the 
Micro-USB port.Specifications, software and cameraThe 
Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ runs Android 5.1 Lollipop and is powered by a 
64-bit octa-core Exynos 7420 SoC with four Cortex-A57 cores clocked at 
2.1GHz and four Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.5GHz. It also has 4GB of 
LPDDR4 RAM. It features a 5.7-inch QHD (1440x2560-pixel) Super-AMOLED 
display with a density of 515ppi. The Galaxy S6 Edge, on the other hand,
 has a 5.1-inch QHD display.The Galaxy S6 Edge+ sports a 
16-megapixel rear camera with f/1.9 aperture and optical image 
stabilisation, apart from a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. The company
 at the event demoed its new Live Broadcast feature which can directly 
broadcast video to YouTube. We asked whether the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6
 Edge will be getting the Live Broadcast feature with future system 
updates, but Samsung India said that no final decision had yet been 
made.Just like its namesake, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ has no 
microSD card slot. However, it does see improvements in terms of battery
 capacity and RAM - the phone has a 3,000mAh battery and 4GB of RAM, 
upgrading the specs of the previous version - the Galaxy S6 Edge has a 
2,600mAh battery and 3GB of RAM. Android has also moved up from version 
5.0 to version 5.1.1.The handset features Fast Charging 
technology which Samsung claimed will allow it to charge fully in 
roughly 90 minutes, though wireless charging will take roughly 120 
minutes. The Galaxy S6 Edge+ comes with a Cat. 6 4G LTE modem and 
supports India's 4G LTE bands.Other connectivity options include 
Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, GPS/A-GPS, and Micro-USB 2.0. 
The Samsung Galaxy Edge+ measures 154.4x75.8x6.9mm, and weighs 153 
grams.The software on the Galaxy S6 Edge+ looked much the same as
 on the Galaxy S6 Edge. The company utilises the curved display edges 
using what it calls Edge Screen panels, which flash in predefined 
colours when any of up to five contacts call. We did not come across any
 other major software changes in our limited time with the handset.Much
 like the Samsung Galaxy S6 (Review | Pictures) and Galaxy S6 Edge, the new curved-screen smartphone
 comes preloaded with Microsoft's Skype, OneDrive and OneNote apps. 
Considering that there is no microSD slot on the handset, Samsung is 
offering up to 100GB of free storage on OneDrive. When 
asked why storage expansion had been dropped, Warsi stated that users 
are steadily moving towards cloud storage option which is why Samsung is
 offering free OneDrive storage. Galaxy S6 Edge+ buyers will also get 
the standard 15GB free cloud storage space on Google Drive.Due to
 constraints at the launch event, we were unable to test the camera on 
the Galaxy S6 Edge+ in optimal lighting conditions. We will have to wait
 till we can perform a full review to see whether the cameras of the 
Galaxy S6 Edge+ are better than those of the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 
Edge.Final ThoughtsOverall, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ 
has a number of small improvements over the Galaxy S6 Edge, but nothing 
that is very noticeable except for the screen size. The company has 
launched the 32GB variant of the Galaxy S6 Edge+ in India priced at Rs. 57,900. The smartphone will go on sale on August 28.The
 biggest competitor to the Galaxy S6 Edge+ will be the Galaxy S6 Edge, 
which can be bought from various stores for
 as little as Rs. 48,500. It remains to be seen whether Samsung will 
phase out the Galaxy S6 Edge now that the Galaxy S6 Edge+ has arrived. 
The Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are also available at lower prices 
than the Galaxy S6 Edge+ which could give it a tough time in the Indian 
market.
