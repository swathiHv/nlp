BlackBerry Passport: First Impressions

At the launch of the BlackBerry Passport on Monday, we got to spend a
 little time with the device and formed some early impressions about the
 device. The BlackBerry Passport will go on sale at retail from October 10 at Rs. 49,990, but at the launch event,
 the company announced that the handset will be available for pre-order 
on Amazon.in and at BlackBerry Exclusive Stores from Monday.Buyers
 who pre-order the phone will also get a Rs. 5,000 gift voucher on 
Amazon.in which can be used towards any purchases, and also 5,000 
frequent flyer miles from Jet Airways.The price tag seems pretty 
steep, but it competes directly with the top flagships of other well 
established brands, a point BlackBerry India Managing Director Sunil 
Lalvani was quick to make at the launch event. But does this unusual 
phone from BlackBerry measure up to the competition?The first 
thing that you'll notice when you see the BlackBerry Passport is its 
massive size. The phone has a 4.5-inch display, which sounds small, but 
due to the square display the display seems larger. At over 3.5 inches 
wide, the phone is also wider than much larger phones. For comparison, 
the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which has a 5.7-inch display, is 3.1-inches 
wide.The square screen takes up most of the phone, but there's a 
short three-row keyboard below the display. The space bar has gone into 
the third row, and a few other keys like shift and symbol are missing 
altogether. If you're a long-time BlackBerry user, the new layout can 
feel jarring and counter-intuitive at first, but the company is 
positioning the keyboard as one of the biggest selling points of the 
Passport.For one thing, it feels tough. The BlackBerry keyboards 
have always been comfortable to type on, and if you're holding the phone
 with both hands and thumb typing, then you can really type accurately 
at a very high speed without even looking at the screen. But the 
keyboard also doubles as a touchpad, which is where it gets really 
interesting. You can still flick up while writing a word to 
autocomplete, flick down to reveal numbers and special characters, or 
swipe to the left to delete one word at a time.BlackBerry also 
claims that its shape allows the phone to display 60 characters in a 
single row, which is the same standard e-book readers also use. This 
sounds great, but in our very short hands-on, it didn't really seem to 
be a game-changer. Responsive design means that websites are quite 
easily read on other phones as well, including the BlackBerry Z10 which 
is this correspondent's primary phone. Our opinion may of course change 
when we have a chance to spend more time with the device.The 
company also showed off some tweaks that the new BlackBerry OS 10.3 
brings, including a dedicated home screen, and the Amazon Appstore 
pre-installed. There's also the BlackBerry Assistant, which can make 
appointments, read out your emails, search for contact details and more 
quite effectively.The build quality of the phone is extremely 
good. It felt solid but not heavy and the keyboard felt great. The 
specifications of the phone are also in line with other top end devices 
as well. The screen is running at a resolution of 1440X1440 pixels, and 
there's a 13-megapixel camera that seemed to be pretty good though a 
little slow to focus. A 2.2GHz processor and 3GB of RAM, along with 32GB
 of storage round out a pretty good device, on paper.The actual 
experience of using the phone was a little awkward thanks to its size, 
and even for a regular BlackBerry user, the new keyboard comes with a 
learning curve. The BlackBerry World app store also remains pretty 
limited, although the Amazon Appstore does widen the net. Not all 
Android apps (notably Google's like Maps) are available on Amazon 
though, which could still end up being a deal-breaker for many.Add
 to that the reputation BlackBerry has gained for dropping prices in 
short order - something the company vehemently denied on Monday - and 
buying the Passport at its launch price may sound like a bad idea to 
many.Stay tuned for a detailed review of the BlackBerry Passport on NDTV Gadgets.
