Strontium Nitro Plus On-The-Go USB 3.0 and Micro SDHC UHS-1 With OTG Card Reader Review

Strontium
 seems to have jumped into mobile storage in a big way. After our 
encounter with the Nitro iDrive for iOS, the company brought our 
attention to a couple of products aimed at Android devices which support
 USB On-The-Go. We've seen flash drives with Micro-USB connectors 
before, but we haven't seen an external card reader.An increasing
 number of Android smartphones do not allow storage expansion, and some 
older ones don't support high-capacity microSD cards. Putting new data 
onto a card and sharing large files with others is sometimes a pain, 
requiring you to take your phone apart and pull out its battery or plug 
your phone into a PC. USB-OTG can come in handy in some of those 
situations. While a flash drive sticking out of your phone is no 
substitute for a tiny microSD card, it can be really handy. You can 
store large files such as movies that you don't need immediate access to
 all the time, without filling up your phone's limited storage space. 
You can transfer files between PCs and Android devices and share them 
with friends. Most importantly, you can always be sure that your files 
are accessible no matter what kind of device you have at your disposal.Strontium Nitro Plus USB On-The-Go 3.0We've
 tested dual-interface flash drives from Kingston and SanDisk in the 
recent past, and this one is no different. It's really tiny, with a 
design that won't get in the way too much when plugged into a phone. It 
supports USB 3.0 on the PC side which is a huge speed improvement over 
USB 2.0. The body looks metallic but feels like plastic. The 
gunmetal finish is quite nice and didn't seem as though it would wear 
off soon.  A large red Strontium logo and the capacity of the drive are 
printed on the front of the swivelling lid. We received a 32GB unit for 
review. This drive would be really easy to lose - the company 
does not provide a lanyard or tag and there's no hook for you to attach 
one of your own. The two ends are pretty much always exposed, so you 
might want to check the larger USB-A plug for pocket lint now and then. 
Other than these things, we have no issues with the design or 
construction quality.We tested the Nitro On-The-Go's USB 3.0 
speeds and found it to perform quite well. SiSoft SANDRA and 
CrystalDiskMark both reported consistent speeds. Sequential read speed, 
which is the best-case scenario for such drives, averaged at 144MBps 
which exceeded Strontium's own claim of 120MBps. Sequential reads were 
of course slower, averaging at 26.68MBps. Random speeds were measured at
 133.71MBps for reads and 6.65MBps for writes. These scores were all a bit higher than those of the Kingston DataTraveler microDuo 3.0.Price: Rs. 749 (16GB); Rs. 1,349 (32GB); Rs. 2,399 (64GB)ProsSmall and lightUSB 3.0 speedConsNoneRatings (Out of 5)Design: 3Performance: 3.5Value for Money: 4Overall: 3.5Strontium Nitro Micro SDHC UHS-1 With OTG Card ReaderThe
 second product we're looking at is something quite unique. It is 
essentially the same sort of dual-interface drive but with a removable 
microSD card instead of built-in flash memory. This of course allows for
 added flexibility when copying photos or making backups - both the card
 and the reader could be very useful on their own and when used 
together.We aren't really impressed with the card reader's build 
quality. The plastic feels relatively low-quality and the USB A plug is 
of the flat variety with exposed contacts. A red LED shines through the 
bottom of the body when it is plugged in. The unit is around the size of
 a standard flash drive if not longer, and won't be easy to misplace. The
 microSD slot doesn't have any eject mechanism so you'll have to pry a 
card out with your fingernail, which is less than ideal. The bundled 
microSD card in particular was difficult to remove because Strontium has
 used an unusual coating process for its label which either makes it 
thicker than usual or makes the grip on the end shallower. The print 
quality is not very good and the label was easily scratched off just by 
using the card in its own reader. The overall finish reminded us of 
CD-Rs with stick-on inkjet labels which never look as good as 
professionally printed discs.Strontium advertises a free app 
called MyBackup Pro, which it values at $4.99 (approximately Rs. 317). 
You'll have to download it from Strontium's own site, which means 
modifying your Android device's security settings to allow apps from 
third-party sources to be installed.In terms of performance, 
we're limited to USB 2.0 speeds here. Strontium advertises the speed of 
the card as "70MB/s 466X", though it's more clear to note that it is a 
Class 10 card which guarantees sustained speeds of 10Mbps and makes the 
card suitable for full HD video recording and bursts of still images. We
 recorded an average sequential read score of 18.84MBps and an average 
sequential write score of 16.3MBps. Random reads and writes came in at 
18.28MBps and 8.25MBps respectively.Price: Rs. 609 (16GB); Rs. 1,099 (32GB); Rs. 2,349 (64GB)ProsFlexible usage possibilitiesWorks with USB-OTG devicesConsBelow-average construction and material qualityUSB 2.0 speedsRatings (Out of 5)Design: 2.5Performance: 2.5Value for Money: 3Overall: 3VerdictBoth of 
Strontium's products offer mobile device users new and interesting ways 
to manage their data. Of the two, the Nitro MicroSDHC with OTG Card 
Reader is certainly more flexible, but less refined. We can't think of 
many situations that call for having an external microSD card reader 
handy - perhaps if you need to copy lots of files between multiple 
phones and/or tablets, some of which don't have microSD card slots. We 
would have liked the product to have been better built, and of course 
USB 3.0 would have been most welcome, but it still enables some 
interesting functionality.On the other hand, the Nitro Plus

Dual-interface drives are becoming more and more common, which is a 
great thing because you don't lose any functionality compared to a

redundant but until then we're glad to have options.
