Spice Stellar Glide Review: A Bland Budget Offering

We
 can't assert enough that the budget smartphone race is heating up now 
in India, especially with multinational brands launching more and more affordable products. Spice is one of the Indian companies that has had Android smartphones in the sub-Rs. 10,000 for some time already, and it now has to face much stiffer competition. We have with us the Spice Stellar Glide, 
which costs less than Rs. 5,000 and could be attractive to someone who 
wants to enter the world of smartphones and understand what
 all the fuss is about.  Design, Features and SpecificationsThe Spice Stellar Glide is available only in silver or gold, but you won't be seeing it at your neighbourhood jewellery store. We got the gold variant for review, and thankfully the front is black. The
 golden rear has a brushed metal finish but the material used is plastic. 
The build quality of the phone is fairly decent and we don't have any 
complaints here.The phone has thick bezels around the screen, 
which actually makes the 4-inch screen look smaller than it is. The Stellar 
Glide is compact by today's standards, and our thumbs could easily reach all corners of the screen. The 3.5mm audio jack and the Micro-USB port are on 
the top of the phone. Spice has decided to place
 the power button right above the volume rocker on the right edge, which makes it inconvenient to 
use. We invariably hit the power button instead of the volume up button, which was very annoying. The
 three capacitive navigation buttons sit below the screen, and 
the front-facing camera and earpiece are above it. The speaker grill is on the rear, along with the primary camera and flash.The 4-inch screen has a resolution of 480x800 and its quality is really 
bad. Viewing angles are so bad that unless we looked at the screen dead on, it was washed out completely. Moreover, individual pixels are easy 
to spot and text is rendered poorly. Under the hood is a 
dual-core Mediatek MT6572 processor clocked at 1.2GHz, and supporting it 
is 1GB of RAM. It has 4GB of internal storage of which only a paltry 
1.1GB is available for users. Thankfully, there is a provision for 
adding up to 32GB of additional storage using microSD memory cards. The 
phone has a 2-megapixel rear camera with flash and a 1.3-megapixel front
 camera. On the connectivity front, the Stellar Glide can connect to two 
cellular networks and accepts regular-sized SIM cards. Both cards 
can connect to 3G networks. It also has Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0 onboard. SoftwareThe Spice Stellar Glide 
runs Android 4.2.2 (Jellybean), and the UI is tweaked slightly with 
colourful icons. Users accustomed to Jellybean will actually feel at 
home with the UI. Also, Spice has added a lot of third-party apps. Documents
 To Go is a decent app for viewing documents. FM radio is always a popular feature and Spice has provided it. GetIt is a 
local classifieds app and GreetZAP can be used to send greetings to 
people on special occasions. SpiceGang is a pointless app that links to a
 website which was under maintenance during our testing period. 
Thankfully, it can be uninstalled. Whatsapp and WeChat are also both 
preinstalled on the phone. The default keyboard has a row of 
numbers on the top and it takes up more than half the 
screen. This would not have been a bad thing if the keyboard itself had been easier to 
use. Our thumbs almost always ended up hitting the wrong letter. There is also a Hindi keyboard with Hindi characters and one 
can also use the English keyboard for transliteration into Hindi. Once 
again, the cramped keyboard means all these additional 
features are difficult to use.CameraThe phone has a 2-megapixel rear 
camera which is fairly ordinary for phones in this price range. As we suspected, the captured pictures are of really low quality. There is no autofocus and we would be surprised if anyone could manage to capture pictures with a decent amount of detail using this camera. There isn't much more to say - you shouldn't really expect a competent camera at this price.(Click to see full size)On the other hand, the 1.3-megapixel 
front camera fares slightly better. When used in favourable lighting conditions, it can produce selfies which are serviceable enough to be shared online. The camera software is easy to use. PerformanceAll we ask
 for in a smartphone priced this low is smooth, lag-free performance. If that is taken care of, we'd be willing to live with other features that aren't up to the mark. Unfortunately, using the Spice Stellar Glide on a daily
 basis could be the ultimate test of patience. It is slower 
than a drug-addled Leonardo Di Caprio crawling across the 
floor in The Wolf of Wall Street. This is not what we expect from a phone 
that is supposed to be smart. Swiping through app screens is laggy, and 
apps take a long time to open and close. There are frustrating lags when performing even simple actions such as pulling down the notifications shade.   For those who love numbers, here 
they are: GFXbench failed to run and 3DMark's Ice Storm test returned a 
score of 1,633, while AnTuTu and Quadrant scores were 9,070 and 2,507 respectively. The phone can't play even 720p videos without
skipping frames. In our battery test, the Spice Stellar 
Glide lasted us exactly five hours and one minute, which is average. The 
call quality was okay but suffered a bit because of low earpiece volume. Spice 
bundles the lowest quality in-ear headset we've ever tested. Even when using 
our reference headphones, sound quality was only slightly better. The built-in speaker is rather loud, though. VerdictThe Spice Stellar Glide
 is available for around Rs. 4,700 on e-commerce websites. If you are foraying into the world of Android for the first time, we 
would strongly recommend avoiding this phone, since it is bound to 
be disappointing. The Moto E and Micromax 
Unite 2 might cost a little more, but they offer far better value for money.  In the meantime, we are still trying to slide the notification shade back up.
