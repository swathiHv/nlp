Samsung Galaxy E5 and Samsung Galaxy E7: First Impressions

Samsung 
surprised us by launching the previously unheard of Galaxy E5 and Galaxy
 E7 alongside the Galaxy A3 and Galaxy A5 at an event in Mumbai 
yesterday. We had a little time with all four devices. Here are our 
early impressions of the new Samsung Galaxy E series.The two new 
smartphones which Samsung has clubbed into a new E series are definitely
 responses to current industry trends. Before even getting into 
specificatons, Samsung touts both devices' screens and front cameras, 
which have become increasingly important selling points.Priced at
 Rs. 19,300 and Rs. 23,000 respectively, the new Samsung Galaxy E5 and Samsung Galaxy E7 will fight for space in the market with other Samsung models, 
including the Galaxy Grand 2 (Review | Photos), Galaxy S4 (Review), Galaxy Note 3 Neo (Review | Photos), and of 
course its siblings, the Galaxy A3 and A5. The Korean giant has never 
had any shortage of smartphone models in the market but honestly, it 
woudn't hurt them to ensure better segmentation so that customers know 
what to choose.Both devices have plastic bodies with metallic 
sides and accents. The rims are more pronounced than those on the A 
series phones. In all other regards, the two look exactly like every 
other recent Samsung Galaxy phone - flat fronts, rounded corners, oblong
 physical Home button, and silver accents all around. This is a look 
we've begun getting tired of, and it would have been nice to have seen 
Samsung break out of its mould. Honestly, it would be very tough to 
identify the E5 and E7 in a lineup of all the devices Samsung has 
released in the past few years.Only white demo units were on hand
 at the launch event, but the company says the Galaxy E5 will also be 
available in black and brown, and the Galaxy E7 will also be available 
in black and blue. There was a subtle horizontal striped pattern across 
the plastic front face.Both phones have plastic rears, with the 
sort of shimmery finish that we first saw on the Galaxy S5, though minus
 any dots (and faux leather stitching). The square camera lenses are 
flanked by a flash and a speaker grille. The headset sockets are 
on the bottom, next to the Micro-USB ports. Volume buttons are on the 
left, while the power buttons and card slots are on the sides. The 
devices do not have removable rear panels.Both phones look physically identical, apart from a slight difference in size, but the specifications do vary.In
 terms of specifications, there are minor differences between the two E 
series siblings. While the E5 has a 5.0-inch screen, 8-megapixel camera,
 2,400mAh battery and 1.5GB of RAM, the E7 has a 5.5-inch screen, 
13-megapixel rear camera, 2,950mAh battery and 2GB of RAM. In other 
regards, the two are the same. The processors are only described as 
1.2GHz quad-core, and both screens have 720x1280 resolutions. Each 
device has 16GB of built-in storage and support for up to 64GB more 
using microSD cards. Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, and A-GPS are also 
common features.Both phones felt comfortable to hold, though the 
E5 was just a bit easier to handle. The first thing that struck us was 
Samsung's current-generation TouchWiz interface, with all the same icons
 and visual flourishes that we've seen since the Galaxy S5 launched. 
This is a matter of personal taste, but we could definitely see reasons 
to tone it all down. Both devices run Android 4.4 KitKat but updates to 
5.0 Lollipop are expected - the sooner, the better.Performance 
felt snappy and the screens were reasonably sharp and rich under indoor 
lighting. We did not experience any sluggishness in our brief time with 
the Galaxy E5 and E7, although detailed analysis will have to wait till 
we can run our own tests when we conduct full reviews. We did not have 
much chance to test the cameras as both devices were tethered.The
 Samsung Galaxy E5 and Galaxy E7 appear to be solid mid-range offerings 
which will compete with similarly priced devices from the likes of HTC, 
Sony, Microsoft, LG, Oppo, Gionee and others. Stay tuned for our full 
reviews, in which we will test both phones' performance, camera quality,
 battery life, ease of use, and more.
