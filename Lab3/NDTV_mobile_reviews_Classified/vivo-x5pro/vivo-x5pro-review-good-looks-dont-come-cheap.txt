Vivo X5Pro Review: Good Looks Don't Come Cheap

Chinese manufacturer Vivo has been a player in the
 global smartphone market for the last couple of years. The Vivo XPlay 
3S was the world's first smartphone with a quad-HD (2560x1440 pixels) 
display when
 it was revealed back in 2013. Earlier this year, the Vivo X5Max (Review | Pictures) staked claim to the 
title of slimmest smartphone in the world, with a thickness of just 
4.75mm. With technical achievements such as these to its name, Vivo hopes to be considered 
among the elite of the smartphone world.The company's latest product 
in India is the Rs. 27,980 Vivo X5Pro. The Chinese version of this 
phone features eye-scanner technology for unlocking the device and 
securing certain data, but the version launched in India does not have 
this feature. Without it, there's very little setting the X5Pro apart from phones such as the Yu Yureka Plus (Review)
 and Xolo Black (Review | 
Pictures), both of which offer
 similar specifications for less than half the money. Is the Vivo X5Pro 
worth the asking price? We find out in our review.Look and feelThe
 Vivo X5Pro is fairly similar to the X5Max in terms of looks, but 
there are a few differences that set it apart. At 6.4mm, the Pro is a 
fair bit thicker than the Max. Additionally, the X5Pro has rounded 
edges, a completely different back, and a smaller 5.2-inch
 screen (though it retains the 1080x1920 pixel resolution). The Super AMOLED 
display is fantastic; it's sharp, detailed, and has truly vibrant colours
 that look real and exciting. It's among the better 
full-HD displays we've seen on a smartphone.There's no denying 
that the Vivo X5Pro borrows design inspiration from the Apple iPhone 6 (Review | Pictures). From
 the curved edges to the speaker grille along the bottom, there 
seems to be a deliberate effort to make the X5Pro look as similar to the
 iPhone 6 as possible. This might have something to do with the immense 
popularity of the iPhone 6 in Vivo's home market,
 and the X5Pro does succeed in mimicking it to an extent.On 
the whole, the Vivo X5Pro is a well-built, well-designed device that 
matches up to the standards set by premium device manufacturers such as
Samsung, HTC, Sony and Motorola. There's a lot to like in the way the X5Pro feels in the hand, as well as its slim metal-and-glass profile, and we're impressed with the aesthetic appeal of this phone.Specifications and softwareThe most 
important component in a smartphone is the SoC, and the Vivo X5Pro uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615. This is strictly a budget-midrange processor that has found popularity in the sub-Rs. 15,000 segment. 
For a Rs. 27,980 smartphone such as the X5Pro to be built around this SoC is 
ridiculous in our opinion, since Vivo doesn't have the reputation orÂ 
brand value in India to justify the premium pricing. Furthermore, when compared to 
the Snapdragon 810-powered OnePlus 2 which costs just Rs. 24,999, the chosen SoC makes even less sense.Other specifications of the Vivo X5Pro are similar to those of many popular budget devices as well. It features 
dual-SIM connectivity with the second SIM slot doubling up as the 
microSD slot; a 13-megapixel primary camera capable of shooting full-HD 
video; and an 8-megapixel front camera. There's 16GB of internal
 storage (expandable with a microSD card of up to 128GB), 2GB of RAM, and a 
2,450mAh battery. Nearly all of these specifications are bettered by the less expensive OnePlus 2.The Vivo X5Pro runs on Android 5.0 with the company's own 
FunTouch OS skin on top. Like many 
Chinese manufacturer UIs aiming to mimic iOS, FunTouch does not have an 
app drawer, instead piling all apps and widgets onto multiple home 
screens. The fonts, icon styling and menus all have an undeniable 
resemblance to iOS. There's a decent amount of customisability and 
control over the device, and the pull-up shortcut menu is particularly 
useful in controlling basic aspects of the phone. It's significantly 
different from typical Android user interfaces in many ways, and this could take some getting used to for longtime Android users. Fortunately,
 there's very little bloatware to be found on the Vivo X5Pro. Most of 
the preinstalled apps are useful and you'd likely want them anyway: 
Facebook, WeChat, WhatsApp, Skype and WPS Office are on the list. Most of the standard apps work well and are 
easy to use.CameraThe Vivo X5Pro retains 
Vivo's usual camera app, which is unsurprisingly designed to look like the iOS one. You don't have access to too many manual settings, but there are
modes such as HDR, Panorama, Night and Bokeh instead. A menu along the bottom lets you choose the picture or video 
size, activate the timer, use touch-to-capture, and change a few other similar options. There are
 quick switches for toggle between the front and rear cameras, activate the flash, go to the gallery, and record video, apart from the standard shutter button. It's simple and gets 
the job done.The camera itself is just about okay for a 
13-megapixel shooter. Photos have a tendency to come out a bit dull, but if 
you make the effort to focus and allow the camera to adjust to light and
 other factors, you can get some decent shots. Colours were 
usually accurate, although we felt that sharpness was lacking in some of
 the test shots we took. It's an acceptable camera nonetheless, but when
the price is considered, you can get similar or better performance from a 
smartphone that costs much less.(Click for full-size image)PerformanceThe Vivo X5Pro 
is usually a pleasure to work with, thanks to the smoothness and fluidity of FunTouch OS. Apps load and run well, and we had no 
day-to-day performance issues during our time with the device. All of 
our test videos, including the heavily encoded ones, ran comfortably 
without any lag or hitches. The new Angry Birds 2
 ran smoothly as well, although it did cause the rear of the phone to 
heat up considerably.Benchmark test numbers were in line with 
what we've been seeing from other Snapdragon 615-based devices. Antutu 
and Quadrant scores were 33,824 and 11,614 respectively, while GFX Bench
 and 3D Mark Ice Storm Extreme returned figures of 14fps and 5,391. 
All of these scores were lower than those of the Yu Yureka Plus and 
Lenovo K3 Note, which as we've mentioned before, cost a fraction of the 
price of the Vivo X5Pro.Battery life is just about average as well. The Vivo
 X5Pro ran for 8 hours, 35 minutes in our video loop test. Call quality
 was decent enough, as was network reception. Wi-Fi reception was poor, 
however, and the phone simply would not pick up a Wi-Fi signal if there were too
 many obstructions. We tested this alongside the Yu Yureka Plus, which 
would at least pick up faint Wi-Fi reception. Audio performance through the 
speakers and earphones is decent enough. On the whole, the Vivo's 
performance is underwhelming, considering its price.VerdictThe
 Vivo X5Pro is a good-looking smartphone that does an impressive job of looking like iOS on the Android platform. If you're a fan of Apple and 
iOS but are averse to paying big bucks or switching away from Android, 
the Vivo X5Pro provides a close approximation of that experience. It's a 
thoughtful device that makes ease of use a priority, and even looks out 
for your aesthetic sensibilities.However, we have a problem with 
the price of the X5Pro. Vivo might like to believe that it's a premium 
brand, and it might even get away with that attitude in its home market, but
 in India it's just another Chinese smartphone maker. It does not have 
the reputation and standing to be able to charge thrice as much as 
similarly specced products, and we believe that 
there is no good reason to shell out this kind of money for this kind of
 a smartphone. If cost is not a factor, we have no qualms in calling the 
Vivo X5Pro a good device. But at its current price, we simply cannot 
recommend it over many of the large number of devices that currently sit in 
the sub-Rs. 15,000 segment. Vivo X5Pro in pictures
