Intex Aqua Speed HD Review: Another Low-Cost Android Option

A little while ago, local Indian brands 
started dominating the low end of the smartphone market. They were able 
to edge out multinational companies by importing low-cost devices with 
features and capabilities that had until then been out of reach. Even if
 the devices weren't all that good, and even if they felt cheap, buyers 
felt great about being able to have touchscreens, play games, watch 
movies and take decent photos. Today, Chinese behemoths are 
playing exactly the same game in India, edging out local companies by 
cutting out the middlemen and using ecommerce to circumvent the bother 
of establishing retail channels. Our performance and value charts are 
now dominated by Xiaomi, Lenovo and Huawei, with several others likely to
 join them soon.That's the backdrop against which Intex has 
launched its latest low-cost model, the Intex Aqua Speed HD. In terms of
 pricing, it goes right up against the category's heavyweights: the 
Xiaomi Redmi 2 (Review | Pictures), Lenovo A6000 Plus (Review | Pictures) and Motorola Moto E (Gen 2) (Review | Pictures). Let's 
see if it can be a disruptive force.Look and feelThe first
 thing that stands out about the Intex Aqua Speed HD is the trim running
 around its sides. Our white unit had a pale gold stripe, and we were 
pleased that it wasn't too garish. However the front face isn't much to 
look at; the camera and sensor cutouts above the screen look a bit ugly 
and the rest of it is as generic as any other low-cost Android phone. 
From some angles, the corners and edges seem inspired by the Sony Xperia
 Z3 (Review | Pictures).The left and bottom are totally blank, with the Micro-USB 
port and 3.5mm audio socket on top and the power and volume buttons on 
the right. The power button is a tiny round nub almost flush with the 
body, which is extremely inconvenient. Intex includes a thin plastic 
case with this phone, and when it's on, you have to dig in with a 
fingernail to use the power button. The rear is plain apart from 
an Intex logo in the middle, the camera lens and twin-LED flash in one 
corner, and a speaker cutout near the bottom. The cutout is flanked by 
two raised points which should allow some sound to escape with the phone
 placed flat on its back on a table.We had quite a bit of trouble
 getting the rear panel on and off this phone.  It has little clips 
around the edges much like other phones, but getting them to snap into 
place and stay there was unnecessarily frustrating. The relatively small
 battery must be popped out to access any of the card slots. There's one
 for a regular-sized SIM, one for a Micro-SIM, and one for a microSD 
card.This is one of the few phones now available with a 
sub-5-inch screen, and as a result it's pretty compact. However, we 
found that a corner would always dig into our palms when used with one 
hand. The grip is otherwise just fine, and it's made even better when 
using the included plastic shell.Specifications and softwareThe
 Intex Aqua Speed HD belies its name with a relatively poky MediaTek 
MT6582M SoC running the show. It has four CPU cores running at 1.3GHz, 
and a Mali-400MP2 GPU. There's 2GB of RAM, which is nice to see, along 
with 16GB of storage space. Unfortunately, microSD card capacity support
 tops out at only 32GB. There's an 8-megapixel camera on the rear and a 
5-megapixel one in front.The 720p HD screen isn't the best we've 
seen, but it's more than adequate. We're a little concerned that the 
battery capacity is only 1700mAh. There's also Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi 
b/g/n, FM radio and A-GPS. 3G is supported, but not LTE. There's also 
HotKnot, MediaTek's innovative feature designed to let two compatible 
phones send each other small bits of information such as contacts, using
 sensors and the touchscreens themselves rather than Blutooth or any 
other radio standard.Although the Aqua Speed HD comes running 
Android 4.4.2, Intex has covered it up with one of the ugliest custom 
skins we've ever seen. It has plenty of neat functionality, but it's 
just visually awful - especially the icons, which look like they were 
designed by a two-year-old. There are useful shortcuts on the 
lockscreen, and two not-so-useful music and camera widgets that take up 
an entire homescreen each (but can be disabled). Thankfully there is a 
distinct app drawer and you can organise icons as you wish.Intex 
has gone with a redundant Menu key below the screen rather than a 
dedicated Recent apps key for multitasking. There's also an iOS-knockoff
 quick settings menu that can be pulled up by flicking upwards from the 
bottom of the screen which duplicates the brightness and toggle controls
 found in the notifications shade. This was particularly annoying as it 
was too easy to trigger from within full-screen apps, but again at least
 it can be turned off.There are also other customisations, 
including gestures and shortcuts - being able to double-tap the screen 
to wake the phone somewhat makes up for the inaccessible power button, 
and you can also swipe in specific patterns to wake and jump directly to
 some of the preinstalled apps.PerformanceThe Intex Aqua 
Speed HD didn't stutter or struggle with the basic tasks we put it 
through. Screen transitions were animated smoothly and we didn't have 
trouble with multitasking. However, benchmark the scores indicate that 
you won't be able to push this phone very much. AnTuTu and Quadrant gave
 us 18,478 and 7,067 points overall which are both on the lower end of 
their scales. 3DMark Ice Storm produced a score of 3,149 which again was
 below par. The phone struggled to play our sample 1080p video 
file, which was smooth but full of artefacts. Furthermore, we found that
 the rear got a bit too hot when the phone was subjected to any heavy 
task. Battery life came in at only 4 hours, 19 minutes in our video loop
 test, confirming our earlier worries. Voices sounded a bit artificial 
in phone calls, though parties on the other end reported no problems.  As
 we said earlier, the screen isn't the best we've seen at this level, 
but it's pretty good. 720x1280 is a decent resolution for a budget 
4.7-inch phone and things are sharp and clear enough. Colours are a bit 
overblown but that's about it. On the other hand, the speaker is 
absolutely dreadful. Our test tracks sounded like they had been mangled 
by heavy machinery and even voices in videos were harsh and 
unrecognisable.(Click to see full size)The final disappointment with this phone was its 
camera. While not entirely awful, we often wound up with shots that were
 completely unusable. It couldn't judge exposure levels very well and 
several of our shots had overblown patches. When reviewed on a big 
screen, photos appeared overcompressed and blotchy, with poor 
reproduction of details - and the less said about video capture quality,
 the better. The only positive was that some of the shots came out with 
nice depth of field effects, especially close-ups of small objects taken
 in favourable lighting. (Click to see full size)The same issues were magnified when 
taking photos at night - most subjects came out completely black, but if
 there was enough direct light, such as the area directly under a 
streetlamp, things were better. There was still far too much noise and 
compression though.VerdictA year or so ago, the Intex Aqua
 Speed HD might have been a good phone to buy at this price level. With 
increasingly sophisticated competitors entering the market, Intex will 
have to do a lot better to stay in the game. The Xiaomi Redmi 2 and 
Lenovo A6000 Plus cost a fair bit less and turn out better performance 
in pretty much every test - and those two are not the only options 
either.We're struggling to think of any factor that might be a 
reason for someone to choose this phone over another, but we're drawing a
 blank. Perhaps its looks might count, if that's what's important. Even 
the fact that it's available outside of limited-quantity flash sales 
doesn't really make up for all its flaws.This isn't a bad phone 
by any means, but it is simply outclassed. Those shopping in the value 
category obviously care about getting their money's worth, and 
unfortunately for Intex this time, you can get better battery life, 
better entertainment, a better camera and more power for less money.
