Samsung Galaxy Note Edge Review: The Smartphone With an Extra Dimension

Who would have thought a phone would
 come along that could make even the mighty Samsung Galaxy Note 4 seem 
boring? For all its top-notch features, the Note 4 lacks the one big 
thing that its new sibling brings to the market - a curved screen. It's 
instantly iconic: the gentle glass that seems to flow right off the edge
 of what should be the front of this phone. The seamless continuation of
 pixels is truly remarkable, and anyone who sees this phone for the 
first time will gape and stare, turning it around in their hands and 
holding it up to their eyes for closer inspection. That's the kind of 
draw it has.In a world of cookie-cutter smartphones (to which 
Samsung is probably the most prolific contributor), the new Galaxy Note 
Edge really does stand out. We're really eager to see what purpose the 
curved screen serves, and whether this phone's functionality matches its
 appearance. Look and feelFinally, Samsung has been forced
 to do something different with the physical design of one of its 
phones. The gently tapered right edge is certainly interesting, but you 
might not really see what's going on at first glance. Most of all, it's 
the asymmetry that really catches the eye. A metal rim frames the screen
 as it curves around, but it protrudes a bit on the right to protect the
 screen and therefore also digs into your palm. Phones usually have 
gentle curves on the back so that they fit comfortably in a hand, but 
there's no way to do that on the screen side of the Galaxy Note Edge. The
 rest of the design is typical Samsung - an oblong Home button ringed 
with silver beneath the screen, a silver earpiece with the sensors and 
front cameras clustered nearby, and patterned plastic all around. The 
rear also has the faux leather texture that has been a staple of Note 
devices for ages now. A heart rate monitor is integrated into the flash 
cutout right beneath the rear camera lens, and the Home button's surface
 doubles as a fingerprint reader. If not for the screen, this phone 
would have been utterly boring to look at - in fact, Samsung might not 
have done its new showpiece justice by giving it such uninspired 
surroundings.As a result of the unique design, the power button 
had to be moved to the top. While most phones had their power buttons 
here till oversized screens became the norm, it's especially difficult 
to reach with one hand because of the uncomfortable right edge. The 
volume buttons are on the left side, and the Micro-USB and 3.5mm ports 
are on the bottom and top respectively, as usual. The S-Pen silo is also
 on the bottom and there's a cutout on the rear to help you pull it out 
with a fingernail.This is a large, hefty phone, even by today's 
standards. Left-handed people will have trouble holding it in one hand 
while using the S-Pen. Despite the use of Gorilla Glass 3, we're really 
uncertain about how the curved screen will hold up if the phone itself 
is dropped.SpecificationsThe most interesting part of the 
Galaxy Note Edge is of course its screen. It has a total resolution of 
1600x2560, divided into a standard 16:9 1440x2560-pixel area for the 
main interface and an additional 160-pixel-wide strip on the side. There
 is no visible seam between the two areas - it really is one single 
continuous panel. The divisions you see are purely down to how the phone's software handles things.Even without the curve, this would be a very 
impressive screen. It measures 5.6 inches diagonally, which accounts for
 the extra width compared to the 5.5-inch 1440x2560 screen on the Galaxy
 Note 4 (Review | Photos). It's bright, crisp, and easy to read in all kinds of environments.The Galaxy Note Edge is powered 
by a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 running at 2.7GHz, with 
integrated Adreno 420 graphics. There is 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage,
 which can be bumped up by 128GB using a microSD card. There's a 3,000mAh battery and a whole raft of sensors. You also get Wi-Fi b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.1, Infrared, NFC, and GPS. Software and usabilitySamsung
 ships the Galaxy Note Edge with Android 4.4.4 and a version of its 
well-known TouchWiz UI skin tailor-made for the curved screen. In terms 
of the S-Pen stylus, the Galaxy Note Edge has all the same features and 
functionality that the Galaxy Note 4 has - no features have been 
reserved for either device.The first thing you'll notice when you
 turn on the Note Edge is the vertical row of shortcut icons on the 
curved end of the screen. In fact, there is no dock on the bottom of the
 screen and no app shortcuts anywhere else on the home screens. The 
strip looks like a natural part of the TouchWiz UI, but the device's 
size and proportions combine to make the upper icons difficult to reach.
 As a concession, there's a duplicate Phone icon in the lower left 
corner of the screen and a button for the app drawer in the lower right 
corner. Samsung has filled the homescreens with widgets and 
panels advertising its own apps and features, such as health monitoring 
via the built-in sensor (or a paired Samsung Gear wearable device). The 
leftmost homescreen is a tile-based newsreader very much along the lines
 of HTC's BlinkFeed.We quickly set about experimenting to see how
 the extra strip of screen space (called "Edge Screen") could be put to 
use. Seven shortcuts are visible, though you can have up to 20 if you're
 willing to scroll. A grab handle on the top can be pulled down to 
reveal non-customisable shortcuts to the voice recorder, torch, 
stopwatch, timer, and of all things a ruler (that is presumably 
calibrated to the exact screen density of the Galaxy Note Edge). A 
handle on the bottom shows a shortcut to the overall Edge Screen 
settings.Swiping left or right will cycle through the available 
panels, and you can choose which ones show up. There's the main 
notifications panel, a pedometer display, Twitter trends, quick 
contacts, assorted topical news feeds powered by Yahoo, and even a 
memory match game. A "Now Playing" panel pops up when you use the 
default music app.Samsung has considered its next steps in this 
regard and so there's a link to download additional panels. These are 
typical little widgets, including a task manager, RAM usage counter, 
data usage counter, weather readout, calendar, CNN news feed, and a few 
more games.Functionally, there isn't much difference to Edge 
Screen panels and ordinary widgets. The main thing is that you get to 
use them while other apps are running. The Edge Screen is also designed 
to be visible when the phone itself is in a case, or just lying on your 
desk. Panels are a little wider than the 160 extra pixels the 
screen provides. When apps are open, they disappear to be replaced by a 
black strip, and if you swipe left or right, they'll slide back in with a
 slight overlap. The black strip can be customised with text that's 
always visible, but this made no sense to us since it was severely 
distracting when we tried playing full-screen videos and games.You
 can also create a custom panel that will show up when the screen is 
locked. Ideally, you should use one of the default wallpapers which will
 line up perfectly with the primary screen's wallpaper. We aren't sure 
why Samsung doesn't allow the primary wallpaper to extend to the Edge 
Screen area, since it's part of the same continuous panel.Samsung
 has also come up with other ways to use the extra screen space. For 
example, all controls in the camera app are moved to the curve area - 
honestly, this isn't much of an improvement since the Galaxy Note Edge 
is even harder to hold than regular large phones, and this puts most 
buttons out of easy reach. While the Music panel overlaps the music app 
and offers duplicate controls, the Videos app displays its primary 
playback controls in the "spillover" screen area. Very few other apps 
seem aware that there is extra screen space and it is unclear whether 
Samsung will give third-party developers the ability to extend into it.Notifications
 and incoming messages show up vertically on the Edge Screen, which can 
be a bit annoying since you wind up twisting your neck or fumbling with 
the outsized device. When your phone rings, caller ID info is displayed 
here and you have to swipe up or down to answer or reject calls. This 
means you have very small touch targets, that too in a place that's 
awkward to reach.Incidentally, the Android status bar isn't 
visible when you rotate the phone into landscape with the Edge Screen on
 top, but is the other way around. This can be a little confusing.There's
 also one major issue with the curved glass - it is absolutely 
impossible to avoid reflections. Usually you can find an angle that 
works for you, but with the Galaxy Note Edge there will always be some 
part of the screen that reflects too much. Your eyes are also 
automatically drawn to the curve, which can be distracting.Other 
than the Edge Screen, there is of course Samsung's S-Pen functionality 
and all the usual TouchWiz extras. You can read all about them in our 
review of the Galaxy Note 4.PerformanceThe Galaxy Note 
Edge has flagship-class hardware and did not fail to impress us as far 
as performance goes. The QHD screen is just flat-out gorgeous, and is 
easily at par with the one on the Galaxy Note 4. Being a part of the 
Note family, we obviously have high expectations of the Note Edge.  
Samsung didn't have to go super-high-end with its first curved screen 
but it did, and there have been no compromises in order to accommodate 
it.We had a generally pleasant experience with the Galaxy Note 
Edge throughout our time testing it. Sure, it's a little awkward to hold
 and we were much more worried than usual about dropping it, but we 
couldn't help but fidget with the Edge Screen and just run our fingers 
over the curved glass from time to time. Benchmark scores were 
very good across the board which should come as no surprise since the 
hardware is pretty much the same as that of the Galaxy Note 4. We 
recorded 49,198 points in AnTuTu and 25,099 overall in Quadrant. 
GFXbench ran at 26fps on the QHD screen, which is pretty impressive. 
3DMark Ice Storm Extreme maxed out, and Unlimited gave us a score of 
19,736. SunSpider was also very snappy, finishing in only 782.3ms.Videos
 look great and we had no problem running heavily encoded samples. The 
main problem was that the Edge Screen curving off into the distance and 
the resulting asymmetrical border around the screen are even more 
distracting in landscape. Your eyes are just automatically drawn to the 
curve. Full-screen games become awkward thanks to the phone's unususal 
grip, the reflection problem, and the fact that a little bit of the 
primary screen area tapers into the curve.The Galaxy Note Edge 
sounded fine in calls and its speaker was mostly adequate for whatever 
we threw at it. Battery life was very good at 14 hours, 15 minutes in 
our video loop test, though this was below the Galaxy Note 4's even more
 impressive mark of 15 hours, 11 minutes.We like the Galaxy Note 
Edge's camera just as much as the one on the Note 4. Optical image 
stabilisation is a huge advantage and 4K video is nice to have even 
though enormous file sizes make it impractical for most purposes. We 
were able to take some very crisp, detailed photos in low light. Shots 
taken in daylight were also generally very good. We noticed some 
slightly aggressive compression that resulted in a lack of clarity on 
metallic surfaces. Camera settings are just as extensive as those on the
 Note 4.VerdictBuyers have not had something truly unique 
to experience (and to show off) in a very long time. The Galaxy Note 
Edge represents a remarkable technological achievement and is exactly 
the sort of product that will make people do a double-take when they see
 it for the first time. In that way, it successfully breaks out of the 
mold.However, it seems as though Samsung is grappling with 
multiple ideas of what the Galaxy Note Edge is supposed to achieve. The 
Edge Screen panels are just sort-of there because something needed to be
 done with the curve. They could work just as well as panels on a 
secondary screen, or a dedicated area of any normal flat screen. We did 
not see any app that truly took advantage of both, the extra screen 
space, and the dimensionality of the curve. Even in terms of 
functionality, the Edge Screen panels are more similar to what you might
 find on a smartwatch than to regular Android homescreen widgets. 
There's also a lot of duplication, which makes the Curve Screen feel 
more disjointed than it actually is. Wider support is desperately needed
 - though of course now that Samsung has successfully mass-produced this
 screen, only imagination can limit where it will go from here. In
 many ways, Samsung is stuck because it is dependent on the Android 
ecosystem which really doesn't accommodate such unique features. Until 
the curve and screen space are truly exposed to third-party apps, we'll 
likely see more disjointedness.All of this means you might want 
to think very carefully before spending an enormous amount of money on 
what is essentially a first-generation experimental product. The Galaxy 
Note Edge is undoubtedly one of the coolest-looking phones of its 
generation, and if that's the only thing that matters to you, then by 
all means, go ahead and buy it. If not, you can get pretty much all the 
same benefits and also save a ton of money by going with the 
woefully one-dimensional though still excellent Galaxy Note 4.  Samsung Galaxy Note Edge in pictures
