Lava Xolo A800 review

Lava entered the smartphone segment with the X900 in the Xolo series way
 back in May 2012. This was the first smartphone in the world to come 
with an 'Intel Inside' tag. However this device failed to set the market
 on fire, partially because of its Rs. 22,000 price tag.So, the 
Indian handset maker has taken a U-turn and returned to familiar 
territory of budget smartphones with the latest members of the Xolo 
series - Lava Xolo A800 and Lava Xolo A700. Both these smartphones run 
on Mediatek's dual-core MT6577 chipset.Priced at Rs. 11,999 the 
Xolo A800 comes with a 4.5-inch (960 x 540 pixels) screen, 512 MB RAM 
and an 8-megapixel auto focus camera with LED flash. Let's find out if 
this device from Lava's Xolo series is a worthy contender in the 
smartphone market.Design/ HardwareThe White coloured Lava 
Xolo A800 looks very similar to Samsung Galaxy S III. However, it comes 
with a matte finish, which makes this smartphone look less plasticky 
than the Galaxy S III.The Xolo A800 has round corners with an 
aesthetically done silver border. The front of the device is mostly 
taken up by the 4.5-inch screen. There are three Android buttons - Menu,
 Home and Back - embossed at the bottom of the screen and a VGA camera 
on the top. The left panel houses the volume keys and Micro-USB/charging
 port.The back panel has an 8-megapixel camera and the loudspeaker. The 3.5mm jack and power/wake button find room on the top panel. In
 terms of hardware, the device is powered by a 1GHz dual-core processor 
with 512MB RAM, has 4GB internal storage expandable up to 32GB with 
microSD.The Xolo A800 is a dual-SIM smartphone and supports GSM 
SIM card in both the slots. On opening the back panel one notices a big 
black rectangular patch attached perhaps to maintain space between the 
battery and the back panel. This looks extremely out of place and we 
would have appreciated if Lava would have paid a bit more attention to 
detailing. DisplayThe Lava Xolo A800 comes with a 4.5-inch
 16M colour capacitive touch screen IPS display with 245 ppi. The 
display and the viewing angles look good. The under-sun visibility on 
the Lava Xolo A800 was decent. The screen used in this smartphone is 
reflective.CameraThe pictures captured through the 8-megapixel auto focus camera
 on board are quite crisp and clear. The Lava Xolo A800 comes with a BSI
 Sensor, which made sure that even the low-light pictures look decent. 
The quality of videos captures through the back camera is good too.There
 is a VGA front camera, which takes average pictures, pretty much like 
any other front camera. All in all, the camera experience on the 
smartphone is good; wish it had a dedicated camera button to help click a
 quick one.Software/ InterfaceThe Lava Xolo A800 runs on 
Android 4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwich). There are five customisable home 
screens to fill with apps and widgets. The software runs quite smoothly 
pretty much like any other stock Android smartphone. There aren't
 too many pre-loaded applications on Lava Xolo A800 except NoteBook and 
Xolo care but one can always download them from Google Play Store. With
 the help of the Noteook app one can take quick notes. These notes can 
be under various categories such as work, personal, family affair or 
uncategorized. Saved notes can be easily accessed through this app.Performance/ BatteryAs
 mentioned earlier, the Lava Xolo A800 comes with Mediatek's dual-core 
MT6577 chipset rather than Intel's chipset that was seen on the earlier 
Xolo A900. However, we found this smartphone to be quite smooth and 
responsive. There were no real lags that we faced while using the 
device. Powered by a 1,600mAh battery, the Xolo A800 is easily able to last a day on single charge.The audio quality is good both on the headphones and the loudspeaker.VerdictFor about 12K, the Lava Xolo A800 is an interesting 
smartphone. It has a good display and delivers a decent performance. 
However, consumers looking for a large screen smartphone might be 
tempted to bend towards, Micromax Canvas 2 A110, which has a 5-inch 
screen and a bigger battery (2000mAh). Micromax Canvas 2 A110 is powered
 by the same processor and runs on Android 4.0. Also, Micromax's device 
is available at a best buy price of Rs. 10,000. Lava Xolo A800 scores 
better than its Micromax only on the display front.ProsSmooth performanceCrisp displayConsAndroid upgrade roadmap not clearPrice: Rs. 11,990Ratings (Out of 5)Design: 3.5Display: 3.5Performance: 3.5Software: 3Battery Life: 3.5Value for Money: 3Camera: 3.5
