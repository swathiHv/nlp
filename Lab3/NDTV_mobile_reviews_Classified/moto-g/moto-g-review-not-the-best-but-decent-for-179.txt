Moto G review: Not the best, but decent for $179

You're not getting the best or the latest technology with Motorola's 
$179 Moto G smartphone. What you do get is a great price for something 
close.Motorola bills the Moto G as the phone for the rest of us - the
 ones who can't afford $500 to $700 for a high-end smartphone. That's a 
big deal overseas, where carriers don't subsidize phones with two-year 
service contracts the way they do in the United States. But even in the 
U.S., more people are moving to contract-free plans and ones that offer 
frequent upgrades, meaning the full retail price is what's going to 
matter.(Also see: Moto G budget smartphone goes official at $179, coming to India in January)The Moto G started shipping in the U.S. this week, 
initially for the GSM networks used by AT&T and T-Mobile. I spent 
the past week testing the Moto G, comparing the phone primarily with its
 more expensive cousin, Motorola's $500 Moto X. I also put it up against
 another lower-cost phone, Google's $349 Nexus 5, as well as the 
premium, $649 iPhone 5s from Apple.Where the Moto G fell short 
was in its camera, battery life and inability to access faster, 4G LTE 
cellular networks. For everything else I tested, the Moto G stood up 
well.Motorola, which is owned by Google Inc., doesn't skimp in 
equipping the Moto G with a speedy processor. Apps launch almost as 
quickly as they do on the phone's pricier rivals. The Moto G runs a 
fairly recent version of Google's Android system, with a promised 
upgrade to the latest, Kit Kat, early next year.(Also see: Moto G dual-SIM smartphone to land in India with Android 4.4 KitKat: Report)The Moto G also 
has a decent screen. It's about as sharp as the Moto X's and the 
iPhone's, enough for 720p video, though the Nexus and various Samsung 
phones do better by offering full, 1080p high definition. The Moto G's 
screen measures 4.5 inches (11.4 centimeters) diagonally, which is 
larger than the iPhone's but small for Android. Colors aren't as rich as
 on the Moto X's display, but if I want a superb visual experience, I'd 
turn to a tablet, a TV or even a movie theater. For a phone, the Moto 
G's screen delivers video quite well.The Moto G doesn't win 
points on size and weight. Although the screen is smaller than the Moto 
X's 4.7-inch (11.9-centimeter) display, the phone overall is a tad 
bulkier and 10 percent heavier. The Moto G has a larger frame 
surrounding the screen - something phone makers have been trying to 
shrink.As for the other shortcomingsCellular accessThe Moto G delivers 3G performance at best. Many parts of the world are 
moving to 4G, but Motorola points out that many of its target markets 
are still upgrading to 3G. Even in the U.S., many regions lack 4G. If 
I'm doing a lot of things requiring top-notch speeds, I'm better off 
finding a Wi-Fi network anyway.Battery lifeThe Moto G has 6 
percent less battery capacity than the Moto X. I got about up to eight 
hours of streaming video on Hulu with the Moto G, compared with nine to 
10 hours on the Moto X. Although the Moto G has a removable plastic 
back, the battery can't be exchanged with a spare. That said, eight 
hours for streaming video is a lot, and you can stretch it to a full day
 with more moderate use.CameraThe main camera has a 
resolution of 5 megapixels, less than the 8 megapixels on the iPhone and
 the Nexus and the 10 megapixels on the Moto X. There's more to a good 
camera than the pixel count, but the pictures I took with the Moto G 
weren't particularly good, especially in low light. They are passable 
for selfies and Facebook posts, but you'll want a better camera for 
keepsakes. Perhaps the money you save on the phone can go to a 
point-and-shoot camera that takes better pictures.The Moto G is 
also short on frills. Part of that stems from Motorola's philosophy not 
to tinker with the Android operating system too much. Many rival phone 
makers do just that and wind up creating more chaos and confusion.Instead,
 Motorola tries to limit what it adds. In the case of the Moto X, you 
can twist the phone to automatically launch the camera. You can initiate
 voice commands by saying, "OK, Google Now." The Moto X also offers 
unprecedented customization when you order; you can choose everything 
from the color of the power button to a personalized message on the back
 cover.The Moto G has none of that. The frills are limited to an 
FM radio tuner, something rare in smartphones. Just plug in a pair of 
headphones, which serves as the antenna. You can swap the back with a 
new plastic cover, but the phone isn't assembled at the factory to your 
specifications.Be aware that the $179 price gets you 8 gigabytes 
of storage, half of what most phones offer. Given all the room your 
photos and video will need, pay the extra $20 for a 16 gigabyte model. 
Unfortunately, there's no slot for memory cards, as some Android phones 
offer.Motorola sells the phone unlocked, meaning you can switch 
carriers as long as they use GSM. Verizon and Sprint are among the few 
carriers in the world using a different technology, CDMA. A Verizon 
version is coming early next year, while Sprint won't say whether it 
will have one.Phone makers have been trying to set themselves 
apart by loading phones with more and more features, only some of which 
are useful. Motorola doesn't try to do that with the Moto G, apart from 
including an FM tuner. Instead, it's distinguishing itself through 
price. No one can question whether that's useful. Moto G - Google and Motorola's new budget smartphone
