Karbonn Titanium Mach Two S360 Review: Best Looking Karbonn Phone Yet

Karbonn has come a long way since it began selling smartphones in 2009. The brand has been spending a lot on 
television advertisements, which could be why sales of Karbonn's phones in 
offline retail channels have been good. Even so, despite this aggressive marketing
 strategy and good sales numbers, the previous Karbonn phone we reviewed
 - the Titanium Machone S310 (Review | Pictures) - didn't really impress us. Now, Karbonn has sent us a review unit of its more premium 
offering, the Titanium Mach Two S360. This phone boasts of a sleek 
design and an octa-core processor, and is available at a price that won't 
burn a hole in your pocket. Let's find out if it can make up for the underwhelming experience we had with its younger sibling. Look and feelStraight
 out of the box, the Mach Two looks classy, and its understated design is in stark contrast to phones by other Indian brands. That said, by no
 stretch of imagination can Karbonn be credited for creating an original
 design here. The Mach Two clearly looks like a mashup of the 
iPhone 5 and iPhone 4 but we don't think it is a bad thing at all. 
Karbonn sells the phone in only one colour - Deep Blue - which 
looks pretty elegant. The phone is a featherweight at 112g and it 
is also pretty slim at 6.3mm. Karbonn manages to maintain the sleek figure of the phone thanks to a unibody design, which also means that the 
battery is non-removable. The back and the front are protected by 
Corning's Gorilla Glass 3. We've seen in the past that Gorilla Glass on the back
 is susceptible to minor scratches and using a case is advised; Karbonn 
provides one in the box. A matte finish metal frame runs along the edges
 of the phone. While the design does look good, we
 are not really satisfied with the sturdiness. It feels flimsy and one 
will need to use it with care. The right side of the phone is 
where all of the buttons and trays reside. The iPhone 5 influence is 
evident in the separate round buttons for volume controls. The power 
button is placed below these volume buttons. It is an odd choice because we invariably ended up hitting the volume down button when we wanted to put the phone to sleep. There are
three trays - two for the Micro-SIM cards and one for the microSD 
card. These trays aren't labelled, which makes it a bit difficult to
 figure out which is which. The bottom has two speaker 
grilles, whereas the top has the 3.5mm jack and the Micro-USB port. The 
camera and the flash sit on the rear. The earpiece and the front camera 
are lined up above the screen, on the front. Karbonn uses a row of 
capacitive buttons below the screen for navigation but they aren't 
backlit. Specifications and softwareThe
 Mach Two has a Mediatek MT6592 octa-core processor which is clocked at
 1.4GHz and has an integrated Mali 450-MP GPU. There is 
1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage space. The Mach Two also accepts 
microSD cards up to 32GB in capacity. Two 8-megapixel cameras are 
available for photography on the front and rear of the camera. Both Micro-SIM cards can connect to 3G networks. Wi-Fi 
a/b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0 make up the rest of the connectivity options. A 
relatively small 1900mAh battery provides the juice for the phone. The 
5-inch screen has a resolution of 720x1280 pixels, translating to a 
pixel density of 294ppi. The colours are adequately saturated and the 
viewing angles are pretty good too. Furthermore, the screen is quite 
legible under direct sunlight. The Mach Two runs Android 4.4.2 
KitKat with a custom skin on top of it. We saw the same UI for the first 
time on its cheaper sibling, the Mach One. The lockscreen displays 
notifications in a panel on the right. There is no app drawer and all 
the icons are arranged on the homescreen itself, which is quite similar 
to UIs we've used on Chinese smartphones. The problem with this skin is 
that the icons are unusually large and sometimes look pixelated even on a
 720p screen. There is no way to change the size of the icons. Changing 
pages on the homescreen feels slightly laggy. Karbonn fills the phone with a ton of third-party apps
 and most of them can be deleted. Notably, the OLX app is a 
system-level app and cannot be deleted.  Performance and cameraThe software bogs down the performance of the 
phone. Apps crashed on a few occasions and overall experience of 
using the software felt bloated. Games run fine, if not to their full 
graphical potential. Benchmark tests returned scores which 
were similar to other phones using the Mediatek MT6592 SoC. In AnTuTu and 
Quadrant the phone achieved scores of 26,878 and 11,182 respectively. 
The Mach Two also hit scores of 15fps and 6,353 in graphics benchmark 
tests GFXbench and 3DMark Ice Storm.The
 phone played all our test videos, including our heavily encoded 
40Mbps sample, without any hiccups. Don't be fooled by the two 
grilles provided by Karbonn for the loudspeaker because only 
mono sound emanates from the left one, It breaks at high volume levels and even otherwise it 
sounds tinny. The bundled headset sounds alright but we have to say that
 the sound quality improves drastically with better quality earphones. 
The sound quality in calls is alright at best and we also faced a few 
call drops. The 1900Ah battery on the phone lasted 6 hours and 33 
minutes in our battery test. This is much better than we expected but it is still not great. We had to reach for the charger
 at the end of the day. The 8-megapixel rear camera on the Mach 
Two is a mixed bag. Our daylight shots looked good when zoomed 
out but when viewed at full resolution we noticed that quite a few 
details were missing. The camera is also slow. 
Thankfully, the images were not overly saturated. In low light, the 
camera took images laced with noise and they were mostly unusable. The 
high resolution front camera is also a below-average performer. The 1080p videos we captured were decent. VerdictAvailable
 for a shade less than Rs. 10,000, the Mach Two goes up against some 
formidable competition. Micromax's Yu Yureka (Review | Pictures), Asus Zenfone 5 (Review | Pictures), and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4G (Review | Pictures) are all really good options in 
this price range. What the Mach Two has going for itself is its design. 
If you can live with less than optimum performance, then the Mach Two 
might be a good (looking) option for you. Also, the fact that the price is not very high in itself is a good selling point for potential buyers.
