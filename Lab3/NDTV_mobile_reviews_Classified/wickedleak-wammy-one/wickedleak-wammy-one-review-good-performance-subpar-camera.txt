Wickedleak Wammy One Review: Good Performance, Subpar Camera

Wickedleak
 is an Indian upstart that distinguishes itself from prominent 
smartphone companies by selling its devices at rock bottom prices. We've recently reviewed the Wickedleak Wammy Neo 
and Wickedleak Wammy Passion X smartphones, and our experiences 
with both devices were not all that great. With that being established, we 
played around with the new Wickedleak Wammy One. This phone packs a 
powerful octa-core processor and has a very low price. Let's find out
 if it is better than its predecessors. Look and feelFinally,
 Wickedleak has made some progress in the design department. The Wammy One is not 
exceptionally attractive, but its looks and build 
quality are comparable, sometimes even better, than other phones in the 
same price range. The slick black body of the phone is made mostly of 
plastic, but it does feel quite sturdy and it might 
withstand some amount of rough usage. At 7.7mm the phone feels 
sleek, which makes holding it in one hand easy. The 5-inch 
screen is surrounded by average-sized 
bezels. There are three capacitive buttons for navigation below the 
screen, which aren't backlit. Unlike tons of cheap phones we've
 used in the past which had poorly marked touch-sensitive buttons, 
these buttons are easy to see and use. Above the display is a slit for the 
earpiece and the front-facing camera. The power button and volume rocker are on the left edge of the phone. They are easily 
accessible and the tactile feedback is pretty good too. The primary camera with flash and the loudspeaker are on the rear. The cover is removable, and the battery compartment, 
two SIM card slots and a slot for the microSD card lie beneath it. Specifications, software and cameraLike
 we mentioned earlier, the phone packs an octa-core processor under the 
hood. It is a Mediatek MT6592 clocked at 1.4GHz. There is 1GB of RAM and 
8GB of internal storage, of which 5.68GB is available to the user. In 
case one wants to add more storage space, a 
microSD card of up to 32GB can be used. There is an 8-megapixel rear camera with a Sony sensor and 
LED flash. There is also a 5-megapixel front-facing snapper for selfies.
 The phone has a large 2,800mAh battery. It can also connect to
 3G, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The 5-inch display has a 
resolution of 540x960. We could see pixellation with our eyes which was a little disappointing. Also, while the viewing angles were decent, legibility wasn't up to the mark as the screen was mostly 
washed out under direct sunlight. The display is also protected by 
Asahi's Dragontrail glass. Unlike the Wammy Neo, the Wammy One 
runs Android 4.4.2 (KitKat), which is the bare minimum we expect from 
any new Android phone today. More importantly, Wickedleak doesn't add a
 skin and keeps the phone free from bloatware as well. The only 
customisation we noticed in the software was the integrated wake-up gestures, 
which worked fine. The default music app is from the Android 
Gingerbread era and the same goes for the default camera app. From the 
design to the features, these apps feel 
archaic. You'd be better off finding replacements in the Play store. (Click for full size)We must say that we were thoroughly disappointed by both 
the front and the rear cameras. The 8-megapixel primary camera captured 
absolutely unusable landscape shots with muddy details and inaccurate 
colours. It performs a tad better in close-ups but then again if 
you are shooting in broad daylight be prepared to deal with overblown 
highlights. Shots captured in low light were even worse. The lens of the
 5-megapixel front camera has a really narrow field of view. 
Additionally, the captured images had a rather prominent green tint on 
top of them. PerformanceThe phone's octa-core processor 
coupled with the low-resolution screen helped it notch up some good results
 in our benchmark tests. In AnTuTu and Quadrant, the Wammy One 
scored 26,921 and 11,328 respectively. The integrated Mali-450 aids in the graphics benchmark tests as well. In GFXbench and 
3DMark Ice Storm Extreme, the phone scored 15.1fps and 3,530 points respectively. The
 good benchmark numbers are also reflective of real-world 
performance. We faced no slowdowns in daily usage and even 
graphically intensive games like Asphalt 8 worked smoothly. The phone 
also played all the videos we threw at it, including the heavily encoded
 40mbps sample. The bundled headset is one of the worst we've ever used and
 we would genuinely urge you to stay away from it. The loudspeaker on 
the other hand gets pretty loud and sounds adequately crisp too. The phone did drop calls intermittently and the sound quality in calls wasn't too great either. In our 
battery life test, the 2,800mAh battery lasted 6 hours and 5 minutes. 
For a battery of this size, this result is average. We noticed that the 
phone lasted us only one day of moderate use in real-world conditions. VerdictThe
 Wickedleak Wammy One undercuts both its predecessors, the Wammy Passion X (Review | Pictures)
and Wammy Neo (Review | Pictures) in pricing, and yet provides the same level of
performance. In addition, it also looks good. However, the phone's Achilles' heel is its camera. The Wammy One is 
available for Rs. 7,990 and only the Xiaomi Redmi Note (Review | Pictures) provides similar 
performance. The Redmi Note clearly has a better screen, 
camera and battery life and is a more well-rounded smartphone than the Wammy One.
