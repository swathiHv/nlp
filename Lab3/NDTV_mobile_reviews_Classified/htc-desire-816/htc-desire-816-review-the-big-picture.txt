HTC Desire 816 Review: The Big Picture

HTC's
 Desire series of smartphones had a decent run during the Android 2.3 
(Gingerbread) era. These mid-range devices catered to people who wanted a phone that would perform well and was reasonably priced. In the Rs. 20,000 - 30,000 range, these phones stood up well to competition from Samsung and LG, amongst others. With the new HTC Desire 816, the company intends to rekindle interest in this segment and hopefully reverse its run of bad fortune. This phone has a large 5.5-inch screen - a crowd 
favourite - and the twin promises of great camera performance and great battery life. 
There is no doubt that this phone will be very popular if those promises are kept.We review the phone to find out if the Desire 816 can actually live up to our expectations.Look and FeelHTC has
 adapted the design it developed for the One (M7), which means thinner bezels on the left and right, and more space on the top and 
bottom to accommodate dual front-firing speakers. The Desire 816 
is more or less consistent with this tall, elongated design, but differentiates itself with a large 5.5-inch display. This makes it wider and taller than 
the rest of the new crop of HTC smartphones. Coupled with a thickness 
of 8mm and weight of 165g, the HTC Desire 816 is solid
 to hold. On the whole, this is a sturdily constructed 
smartphone. One problem with the polycarbonate body is that it 
involves both glossy and matte textures. As a result, you'll have to deal with issues inherent to both types of finish. In our white 
variant, we noticed that the glossy back attracted loads of smudges while the matte 
edges and front were dust magnets. HTC decided to move all the physical buttons to 
the left edge, probably to make room for a flap on the 
right edge which houses the two Nano-SIM slots and the microSD card slot. The power button and volume rocker on the left edge 
are made of metal - a stark departure from the predominantly plastic 
body. The placement of the buttons is unusual, but not too difficult to get used to. The Micro-USB port for charging is on the bottom, and the 3.5mm 
audio jack is on the top alongside an additional microphone.  Features and SpecificationsOn
 paper, the HTC Desire 816's specifications are on par with those of the Moto G (review) which
 retails at almost half the price. With a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 
processor clocked at 1.6GHz, it is evident that the HTC Desire 816 is 
not aiming for top-of-the-line specifications. We wish HTC had chosen at 
least the Snapdragon 600, which is more suitable for mid-range smartphones. Graphics are handled by an integrated Adreno 305 GPU. The phone has 1.5GB of RAM and 8GB 
of internal storage, of which only around 4GB is available for use. This is disappointing, but thankfully HTC allows expansion up to 128GB 
using a microSD card.The HTC Desire 816 has a 
13-megapixel rear camera with a flash, and can record 1080p videos. It 
also has a 5-megapixel front camera that can be used to capture even the pimples 
on your face with great clarity in the Selfie mode. The phone accepts 
two Nano-SIM cards, both of which can connect to 3G networks. The
 5.5-inch screen has a resolution of 720x1280, which means a pixel density of 267ppi. Many of the current crop of 5.5-inch 
smartphones have the same specifications. The screen is crisp enough, but is dull even at maximum 
brightness. This in turn amplifies reflections and affects sunlight legibility and viewing 
angles. We think the Samsung Note
 3 Neo's (review) screen is marginally better. SoftwareWe are glad 
that HTC has decided to ship the Desire 816 with the latest version of 
Android - version 4.4.2 (Kitkat) - and the new HTC Sense 6 skin. It 
looks identical to the software running on the new HTC One (M8) (review). This 
skin has the same Blinkfeed news reader on the extreme left homescreen, and a 
vertically scrolling app drawer. Blinkfeed 
trumps Samsung's Magazine app by a long shot. HTC also provides users with 
two other interfaces that can be used for specific purposes - Car Mode and Kid Mode. In 
the Car mode, there are a few often-used icons for easy access, and
 the Kid Mode lets parents lock down settings and available apps. HTC bundles 
the Polaris Office 5 suite and an app called Scribble, which allows users to
 take notes. The HTC Setup Mode is available whenever you want it, and is 
probably the best way to customise the phone. HTC
 has pre-installed Zoe, a special camera app that it claims can "capture
 life like no other smartphone can" on the Desire 816. Unfortunately, 
it is not available, and you'll only see a "coming soon" message when you launch it. Till that happens, we'll just have to settle for capturing life with the default camera app.CameraUnlike
 the Ultrapixel camera on the HTC One series, the Desire 816 has a standard 
13-megapixel camera and it is surprisingly good. We give full marks to 
HTC for advertising it right. (Click to see full size)Pictures shot in broad daylight 
are crystal clear, and have very little noise. 
There is very minimal loss of detail, though on closer inspection, we 
noticed different shades of green were slightly mismatched. The camera 
tries hard to latch on to any source of light in low-light shots and the
 captured images, after struggling with the focus, have a watercoloured 
effect to them. Then again, the results are definitely much better than what's possible with all 
the other phones in this price range. In fact, at times, it performs 
better in low light than some higher priced phones too. The only negative point is that recorded 1080p video loses some details. (Click to see full size)If
 the rear camera was surprisingly good, the 5-megapixel front camera came as a
 revelation. We did not dare to upload the selfies captured by this 
camera on a social network as all the pores and pimples on our oily skin were captured perfectly. Images are well detailed and better than those taken with
some phones' primary cameras. It would have been great if the 
lens had been a bit wider for group shots taken at arm's length. The
 camera software is mostly minimalistic with a lot of manual settings, but HTC goes bonkers when it comes to offering different picture modes to shoot in. 
There are 16 modes in total, some of which are quite unnecessary. For 
example, the Mono mode lets users choose a colour cast, which makes the dedicated grayscale and aqua modes redundant. All said 
and done, we had the most fun with the Depth of Field mode where the 
camera artificially creates an illusion of depth by blurring those parts
 of the image which are not within the focus area. Despite this 
artificial illusion, images looked stunning with only a slight 
loss of detail. With all this power to play with, we don't think users will miss Zoe. PerformanceDuring
 the testing process, we got so caught up with the great camera performance
 that we almost failed to notice how buttery
 smooth the Desire 816 was to use, and how little lag we encountered. This is mostly due to the 1.5GB of RAM 
under the hood. It is almost as fast as the Moto G, if not faster. After
 playing around with the phone, we were confident that the benchmark numbers would be pretty good. Here are 
some of them for your consideration: In Antutu and Quadrant, the phone scored 
21,182 and 13,332 points respectively. Graphics performance wasn't as impressive,  with scores of 11 fps in GFXbench and a total of 5087 in multiple 3DMark Ice Storm tests. These scores might not compare well to those of other phones in this segment with Mediatek's octa-core processor under 
the hood, but they are still workable. 
The Desire 816 is not ideal for playing intensive games like Asphalt or Shadowgun 
which require better graphics capabilities. Media playback on the Desire 
816 was a breeze. It played all the video files we threw at it without any skipping or drop in 
frame rates. Also, watching videos is great fun on the huge screen. The dual front-firing speakers are not as loud as the BoomSound 
speakers on the HTC One series, but channel separation is good. The music quality on our reference headphones was 
top-notch and the driver inside the phone works overtime to enhance the 
quality of sound. During calls, the phone performs admirably in latching
 on to network but the person on the other end couldn't hear our voice clearly. On the 
battery performance front, the 2600mAh battery lasted us 11 hours and 7 
minutes before it needed to be charged. We expect it to easily last for a
 day and a half of regular usage, which is more than what normal 
smartphones can manage. VerdictAfter playing with the HTC 
Desire 816, we really wanted to head outdoors, 
headphones on,  and take photos of all the scenic beauty surrounding us.
 The best part is that we wouldn't have to worry too much about battery 
life either. Priced at Rs. 23,990, it is very easy to recommend 
this phone. It feels premium, and has a far superior camera, 
battery life, higher internal memory capacity and better performance compared to the Moto G, which feels worth the price difference. If raw performance is the need, we 
suggest taking a look at the Gionee Elife E7 (review) instead. Any which way, it looks 
like HTC's efforts are not going completely unnoticed since some reports suggest that the company is 
forecasting a profitable quarter based on the sales of 
the One (M8) and the Desire 816.
