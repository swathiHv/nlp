Micromax Canvas Nitro Review: Lasts Long, Really Long

Who
 would have predicted that Micromax would have to play catch-up in the 
price band it ruled just a year ago? With the entry of powerful and 
competent devices from global manufacturers which cost less than Rs. 
15,000, Micromax has had to slightly rethink its strategy. The newly 
launched Canvas Nitro features impressive specifications and a price tag
 that would have been a good Rs. 5,000 higher before this budget war 
happened.We reviewed the Micromax Canvas Nitro to find out if it 
can hold its own against heavyweight brands such as Motorola, Asus, and 
the surprise star Xiaomi. Look and feelOur instant 
reaction on holding the Micromax Canvas Nitro, with its weight of 146g, 
was that it felt heavier than the other options in this price range. The
 rear of the Micromax Canvas Nitro looks quite similar to that of the 
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (Review | Pictures) with its faux stitched-leather finish. The front 
is mostly uninspiring with the 5-inch screen taking up most of the real 
estate. In fact, the phone on the whole looks rather tepid and does 
nothing to capture attention. We got the white version for review
 but this phone is also available in dark blue. The power button sits on
 the right edge whereas the left edge houses the volume rocker. Both 
physical buttons have very little travel. A 3.5mm audio jack can be 
found on the top of the phone, and the Micro-USB port for data transfer 
and charging is on the bottom. Above the screen are the notification 
LED, a front-facing camera and an earpiece. Micromax has decided to go 
with backlit capacitive buttons, but they are not illuminated evenly. 
The rear cover can be removed easily and under it one can find the 
battery, two slots for Micro-SIM cards, and a slot for a microSD card. Specifications and softwareMicromax
 has fitted the Canvas Nitro with the octa-core Mediatek MT6592 
processor which is clocked at 1.7GHz and has an integrated Mali-450 GPU.
 The Canvas Nitro also features 2GB of RAM. Out of the 8GB of internal 
storage space, only 5.68GB is available for users but you can expand this
 by up to 32GB using a microSD card.The phone accepts two 
Micro-SIM cards and they connect to the 850/ 900/ 1800/ 1900/ 2100 network 
bands. It can also connect to Wi-Fi networks and other Bluetooth-enabled
 devices. A 2500mAh battery provides the juice for the device.  The 
5-inch 720p display is great for the most part with vibrant colours and 
good viewing angles, but things go downhill when viewed under direct 
sunlight. The screen is very reflective and we had a difficult time 
trying to use this phone because of this. Micromax has tweaked 
the software to add a few additional features which have been mostly 
borrowed from Samsung's Touchwiz and HTC's Sense UI. For starters, 
Micromax adds a QuickLook page to the left of the primary homescreen.  
QuickLook is nothing but Micromax's attempt to emulate HTC's BlinkFeed 
which itself is based on Flipboard. One more swipe from the QuickLook 
page shows the settings where one can choose which topics the feed 
displays. One can also add Facebook and Twitter accounts so that they 
can reflect in the feed. However, there is no way to add feeds from 
specific websites. Moreover, there is a weird blue tint to the 
background of text when any article is opened, making it rather 
difficult to read. The lockscreen has a simple swipe-up gesture, 
and available notifications are displayed on a red band. Some of the 
other software tweaks include the ability to pause video playback when 
the user looks away, which is a direct lift of Samsung's 'Smart Pause' 
feature. It works most of the time, if ambient lighting is good enough. 
There are a few tweaks to the camera software which we shall discuss in 
the camera section. There are a ton of third party apps and they 
are mostly bloatware - apps that are just pointless. The Clean Master 
app has a widget on the home screen and it is very intrusive unless one 
changes its settings. There are also apps like M! Games and M! Live 
which just jump to Web pages. What's worse is that none of these apps 
can be uninstalled. SwiftKey, a keyboard app that uses a proprietary prediction technology 
that works really well, is the default keyboard on the phone. We approve
 of this implementation and think that users will like it too. Micromax also bundles the rather annoying Truecaller app, that claims to
 be a global telephone directory with a caller ID feature. The 
problem with this app is that it scans the contact lists of people who 
use it and make it available to other Truecaller users thereby raising 
privacy concerns. While some may refute that it could be extremely 
useful in certain cases, it sends an open invitation for miscreants to 
misuse information that some users wish to keep confidential.CameraThe
 13-megapixel camera on the Micromax Canvas Nitro is the perfect example
 of why the megapixel count doesn't matter. The lens and sensor of this 
phone clearly don't do it any justice. As a result when seen at actual 
size, it is quite evident that captured photos lack a lot of details. If
 viewed closely one can observe a blue tint to photographs which means 
that the white balance is off. In low light, the camera failed to 
capture any detail whatsoever. The only upside is that the camera can 
focus and shoot images really fast.Captured video is recorded in 
.3gpp format for some reason and the quality is really bad. The camera 
couldn't stay focused on any subject, and video was just very dim. 
Surprisingly, the fixed-focus 5-megapixel front camera can capture 
decent images but it is not as good as the one on the Sony Xperia C3 Dual (Review | Pictures). (click for full size)Micromax has added a camera widget to one 
of the home screens, which directly lets a user access some of the 
camera's many modes. The selfie mode is self-explanatory. Frontback mode
 takes pictures with both cameras and shows them in splits creen. We fail
 to understand the novelty of this mode and think that Micromax could 
have stuck to the tried-and-tested picture-in-picture format used by 
other smartphone companies. There is a Stable mode in which a reading 
like a heart rate monitor moves on top of the screen to show you when 
the device is stable enough for shooting. The camera app by itself 
provides a lot of cool options like saying the word 'cheese' to capture 
an image (which didn't work most of the time). Also, there are a few 
manual controls as well. But hiding often-used modes like HDR deep in 
the settings menu is rather annoying. PerformanceWe 
didn't face any hiccups while using the Micromax Canvas Nitro every day.
 It has smooth transitions and works quite well. It is a great 
smartphone experience. We even tried high-end games like Asphalt 8 and 
Dead Trigger 2, and we didn't face any lag whatsoever. The 
benchmark numbers are second only to the slightly more expensive Xiaomi 
Mi 3 (Review | Pictures) in this price range. In AnTuTu and Quadrant benchmarks the 
phone managed to score 28,302 and 13,444 respectively, which are more 
than respectable numbers. The phone also hit 13.4fps and scored 6,453 in
 our GFXbench and 3D Mark Ice Storm graphics tests. The Canvas Nitro 
played all the heavily encoded videos we threw at it without any 
hassles. The loudspeaker is not too loud and moreover it distorts at 
high volumes. The bundled earphones will serve the purpose for most 
people, which is a good thing. The call quality is really good and the 
sound on both ends of the call was crystal clear.We were 
completely floored at the battery performance of the Canvas Nitro. It 
managed to play video in a loop for 16 hours and 9 minutes before it 
died on us. This is exceptional battery life and this one performance 
stat alone is enough to sway a lot of buyers in the favour of this 
phone. VerdictThe Micromax Canvas Nitro does a lot of 
things one would expect from a smartphone and does them well for the 
most part (except for the camera, of course). It is priced at Rs. 
12,900, which is a great bargain. Unfortunately for Micromax, the market
 is filled with a ton of options in this range and the upgraded Moto G 
(Review | Pictures) is huge competition for the phone. The 
leverage that Canvas Nitro has over most of the other phones like the 
Asus Zenfone 5 (Review | Pictures), Xiaomi Mi 3 (out of stock for now) and the Moto G 
(Gen 2) is that it will be available in retail channels as well apart 
from any one online store. We would recommend this phone to anyone who 
needs exceptional battery life, as long as they're willing to accept the
 lousy camera as a tradeoff.
