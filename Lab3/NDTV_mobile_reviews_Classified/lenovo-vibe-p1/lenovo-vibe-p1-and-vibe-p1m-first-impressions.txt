Lenovo Vibe P1 and Vibe P1m First Impressions

The Lenovo Vibe P1 and Vibe P1m, are two smartphones that know where 
their priorities lie - battery life. The P1 and the P1m are backed by 
incredible 5000mAh and 4000mAh batteries respectively. If that wasn't 
enough, the two smartphones have a dedicated switch on the left, which puts the smartphones into a power saving mode. Putting 
this button on phones that already have a large battery seems like a bit
 of a waste to us, but then we aren't running a corporation that just 
bought Motorola, so what do we know.Back to what you came here to 
read - how the two smartphones perform. This power saving mode isn't too
 dissimilar to what you've seen on other smartphones - it basically 
takes away your standard launcher and leaves you with a handful of apps 
you can use while in this mode - the Phone (dialler), Contacts, SMS, and
 Clock are the usual suspects. Lenovo's implementation leaves mobile 
data on - we couldn't verify if it disables 3G/ 4G in a bid to save 
power - and also a chat app. The unit we saw had QQ available, and we 
were told the international variant will let you pick WhatsApp instead.(Also see:  Lenovo Vibe S1, Vibe P1, and Vibe P1m Smartphones Launched at IFA 2015)Lenovo's
 power saving mode launcher has room for six apps on the 'home screen' 
and you have some amount of control over which apps should be shown. Lenovo lets you pick from a pre-approved list of apps that you can use 
in this low power state. The unit we saw had only two options available 
other than the five apps we mentioned above. What apps need to do to 
make the power saving mode cut isn't available, though it's clear your 
browser will never be on that list.In terms of the rest of the 
specifications, the Lenovo P1 is a dual-SIM (dual LTE) smartphone that 
comes with a 5.5-inch full-HD display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 
protection. It is powered by a Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor 
alongside 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. the Lenovo P1 has a
 13-megapixel rear and 5-megapixel front shooter. The P1m is more 
modest, with a 5-inch 720p display, 2GB RAM, and 8-megapixel rear 
camera.(Also see:  Lenovo Vibe P1 and Vibe P1m full specifications)
