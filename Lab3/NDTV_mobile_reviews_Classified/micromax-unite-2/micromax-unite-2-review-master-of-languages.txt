Micromax Unite 2 Review: Master of Languages

The
 Moto E runs Android 4.4.2 (Kitkat), has decent specs, and most 
importantly, is dirt cheap. It set a new standard for phones of its 
price, and many Indian OEMs sat up to take notice. We now have a good 
number of phones launching with Android Kitkat, and many more are on 
their way.One such phone is the Micromax Unite 2. Micromax tries 
to set itself apart from the competition by providing support for 21 
Indian languages. We review the phone and try to find out if it can be a
 worthy competitor to the Moto E, or if it fits into a niche of its own.
 Design, Features and SpecificationsThe Micromax Unite 2 
is just another slab. There is absolutely nothing in the design that 
distinguishes it from the competition. Frankly, it is unassuming and 
boring. This might be the reason Micromax has tried multiple colour 
options. We received the Mystic Grey edition for review, but the rear 
cover can be swapped out, and you can get replacements in other colours 
such as Balmy Green, Raging Red and Pristine White. The 4.7-inch device 
is also heavier than its competition, but that actually makes it 
reassuring to hold. The Micromax Unite 2's left edge is bare, 
while the right edge has the volume rocker and power button. On the 
bottom edge is a microphone, and on the top edge are the 3.5mm audio 
jack and Micro-USB port. The rear cover is rather easy to pry open, but 
is rather flimsy and felt like it would snap if we used even a little 
too much pressure. On opening the rear cover, we found one regular-sized
 SIM card slot and one Micro-SIM card slot, apart from the microSD card 
slot.Under the hood of the Micromax Unite 2 is a Mediatek MT6582 
quad-core processor clocked at 1.3GHz, with an integrated Mali 400MP2 
graphics processing unit. The phone has 1GB of RAM and 4GB of internal 
storage, of which only around 890MB is free for users. The phone also 
has a 5-megapixel rear camera with flash which can shoot 720p videos, 
and a 2-megapixel front camera. The 4.7-inch screen has a WVGA 
display, which translates to a resolution of 800x480 and a pixel density of 
approximately 199ppi. It becomes immediately apparent that the screen is
 of low quality since jagged edges are immediately visible on icons and 
text. Sunlight legibility and viewing angles are also not up to the 
mark. The screen is definitely not a patch on that of the Moto E's.SoftwareIt
 is quite heartening to see that Moto E started a trend - low-end 
smartphones with the latest and best version of Android. Let's hope that
 this will increase the install base of Android 4.4.2 (Kitkat). The 
Micromax Unite 2 runs Android Kitkat and surprisingly the company 
doesn't customise its look and feel too much. The translucent app tray 
icon and slightly enlarged icon set make it look very similar to Android
 Kitkat on the Nexus 5, which is very good.Despite all the 
compliments that we could shower upon the software, Micromax's 
insistence on adding its very own appalling bloatware is a pain, mainly 
because most of these apps redirects to Web pages. Apps called 
Gamesclub, M!Games and M!Live are guilty of this behaviour. The Mad app,
 which pays users to watch advertisements after registering their phone 
number, is also preloaded. There are trial versions of games including 
Burn the Rope and Smash It. Coming to the most important bit, the
 support for 21 Indian languages, Micromax claims that the Unite 2 is 
the first phone to support so many languages. Basically, what we get is a
 keyboard and a phonebook app called Reverie Phonebook that can be used 
in any of these Indian languages. In the default mode, the keyboard is 
in English and Micromax has changed the layout slightly. The caps lock 
key is in the lower left corner and the number pad shortcut is above it,
 instead of the other way around. Users who are accustomed to the usual 
Android or iOS keyboard layout are bound to find this frustrating. Apart
 from this small niggle, the keyboard is alright. Long pressing the 
spacebar brings up the multiple language options and it is fairly easy 
to type. However, we found that the matras in Hindi were difficult to 
distinguish since the fonts were really small. All in all, we appreciate
 Micromax's attempt and this feature does mean that the Unite 2 is in a 
niche all by itself.CameraNotwithstanding the modern 
version of Android, the camera app takes us back to the days of Android 
2.3 (Gingerbread). It has three extra modes: Panorama, Live Shot and 
Beauty Shot. The camera allows for basic manual settings such as 
changing the exposure value and white balance. Fourteen scene modes are 
buried inside the settings menu. The 5-megapixel camera is a 
competent shooter in daylight conditions. Colours are natural and 
details aren't bad either. There is a slight problem with focusing 
correctly, and sometimes the background in captured images tends to get 
overexposed. In low light, the camera falters. Also, captured 720p 
videos are jerky and don't have very good detail. The 2-megapixel front 
camera isn't very sensitive, and what we got was mostly underexposed 
images. Compared to the fixed focus camera on the Moto E, the Micromax 
Unite 2 does a fairly decent job and is definitely better. (Click for larger size)PerformanceThe
 Moto E has a smoother UI and feels more user-friendly in daily usage, 
but surprisingly, the Micromax Unite 2's benchmark scores are much 
better.In our AnTuTu and Quadrant benchmarks, the Unite 2 
returned scores of 17,643 and 8,817 which are significantly better than 
the Moto E's numbers. However, Motorola's budget model trumps the Unite 2
 in graphics performance, with the latter registering 9.8 fps in the 
GFXbench test compared to the Moto E's 10.7 fps. The Unite 2 
managed to play 720p videos without any hiccups but 1080p videos 
stuttered occasionally. Once again, the Moto E comes out on top here. In
 our battery test, the phone lasted six hours and 27 minutes before it 
died. We think it should last around a day with normal use. We found 
that the speaker's volume was low, which hampered the call quality a 
bit. VerdictThe Micromax Unite 2 was priced at Rs. 6,999 
at launch, the same as the Moto E, but it has come to our notice that 
prices are higher right now with several e-commerce sellers quoting as 
much as Rs. 7,799. Also just like the Moto E, this phone is generally 
out of stock. Even with that inflated price, the Micromax Unite 2
 doesn't seem like a bad deal. At this price, you'll have to settle for 
compromises in the display quality, very little internal storage, and 
Micromax's bloatware. The Unite 2 does have a better camera than the 
Moto E, and the support for 21 languages will be attractive for many 
users. We are glad that Indian brands are stepping up their efforts to 
create competent budget phones. The under-10k segment is heating up, and
 this makes us glad.
