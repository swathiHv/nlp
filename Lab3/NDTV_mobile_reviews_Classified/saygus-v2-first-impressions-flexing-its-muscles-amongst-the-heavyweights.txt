Saygus V2 First Impressions: Flexing Its Muscles Amongst the Heavyweights

At
 CES in January, a small upstart from Salt Lake City, Utah in USA - 
Saygus - unveiled a 
smartphone
 that promised to be your definitive Android experience. The Saygus V2 
(pronounced Saygus V-squared) packs in more features than you might ever
 require.In a span of two months, Saygus has gone from 
introducing the phone to accepting pre-orders from around 51 countries -
 a number put forth by the company itself. Additionally, the executives 
at Saygus told NDTV Gadgets that they are receiving a lot of requests 
and interest in the phone from India as well. For all you backers out 
there and for those who are merely intrigued by the Saygus V2, here are 
our first impressions of the device.At first glance, the phone 
feels chunky at 9.7mm compared to other flagship Android smartphones in 
the market. That said, Saygus has managed to keep the weight of the 
phone at a comfortable 141g thanks to the use of materials like anodised
 aluminium and magnesium alloy. The rear is protected by kevlar coating 
which was first used by the Motorola Razr back in 2011. Interestingly, 
Saygus tells us that the engineer who worked with Motorola for the 
kevlar back also engineered the V2. The phone uses waterproofing 
technology by another Utah-based company HZO. A fractal antenna on the 
rear, provided by a company of the same name as the tech, apparently 
boosts cellular network reception.The edges of the phone are 
raised, which should mean that falling face-down will not affect the 
display first on impact. The 5-inch display has a resolution of 
1080x1920 (FHD) and is protected by Corning's Gorilla Glass 4. The 
screen looked adequately bright and sharp, and it is makes use of 
Quicklogic's ArcticLink III VX technology to enhance the sunlight 
legibility, which we couldn't test indoors. The Saygus V2 uses two 
Harmann Kardonn speakers below and above the screen. Unfortunately, 
these speakers are not active since it was an engineering prototype and 
as a result we couldn't test the sound quality.Similarly, the two
 cameras on the phone - a 13-megapixel front-facing one and 21-megapixel
 primary camera - were both inactive. The optics are sourced form Sharp 
and Saygus claims that both include optical image stabilisation, which 
should improve low-light performance. The phone also includes a 
biometric fingerprint scanner on the right edge, which wasn't active 
either.The piece de resistance of the Saygus V2 is its 60GHz 
Wireless HD capability. In collaboration with Silicon Image, Saygus has 
added a chip that can send visuals wirelessly to your HDMI-enabled 
television. Moreover, it doesn't send the signals over Wi-Fi. Saygus 
claims that the FHD transmission quality is better than that of a 
connection established by Miracast protocol. A small device (still a 
prototype) to be sold as an add-on accessory, connects to the HDMI port 
on your television and receives the wireless signal. We noticed that the
 picture quality was impeccable and a demonstration of Riptide GP2 
worked without any lag. If our initial experience is any indication, 
then we hope that more smartphone brands can lap up this feature for 
their flagship devices. The one drawback in an otherwise 
feature-rich phone is that it is running Android KitKat. However, Saygus
 executives did state that they did test a Lollipop build on the Saygus 
V2 and weren't happy with the multiple bugs they encountered during 
testing. So there's hope it will get Android 5.0 Lollipop update in the 
future.Internally, the Saygus V2 packs Qualcomm's Snapdragon 801 
quad-core processor clocked at 2.5GHz and 3GB of RAM. It also has 64GB 
of internal storage and two microSD card slots that can accept memory 
cards up to 128GB of storage space. If that wasn't enough, Saygus 
executives mentioned that they are in talks with Sandisk to add support 
for its latest 200GB microSD card (also announced at 
MWC); which takes the potential maximum storage space up to a whopping 
464GB!The Saygus V2 is expected to support every any kind of 
network, GSM or CDMA, across the world. It has a 3100mAh battery inside 
and has support for wireless Qi charging as well. Root access will be 
made available to every user and it will also support multi-boot from a 
microSD card.Since we only got to play around with the 
engineering prototype of the Saygus V2, we couldn't experience a lot of 
the functions. Having said that, if the final retail device manages to 
live up to its promises we are possibly looking at a phone that could 
give others a run for their money. The Saygus V2 is available for 
pre-order online at $599 (approximately Rs. 37,300).
