Moto X review

In the four decades since Motorola first showed off a prototype of the 
world's first cellphone, the company has watched Apple, Samsung and 
other innovators surpass it in sales. With Google as its new owner, 
Motorola is introducing the Moto X, a phone notable for innovations in 
manufacturing, as part of an attempt to regain its stature.Yes, 
there's plenty the Moto X offers in terms of software, including the 
ability to get directions, seek trivia answers or set the alarm without 
ever touching the phone. There's good hardware, too, including a body 
that's nearly as slim as the iPhone 5, but with the larger, 4.7-inch 
screen that is comparable to those found in rival Android phones.But
 what's really special about the Moto X has nothing to do with making 
calls, checking Facebook or holding it in your hands. Rather, it breaks 
from the pack by allowing for a lot of customization. You can choose 
everything from the color of the power button to a personalized message 
on the back cover.To make those special orders possible, Motorola
 is assembling the Moto X in Texas, making it the first smartphone to be
 put together in the U.S. Motorola promises to ship custom designs 
within four days, faster than it would be able to if the company had 
chosen to make the Moto X halfway around the world in Asia, as other 
phones typically are. (Phones for overseas markets will be made 
overseas.)You can still buy the phone the traditional way, in 
black or white. Walk into a store, pay about $200, sign a two-year 
service agreement (or installment plan with T-Mobile), and off you go 
with a brand new phone.But that's boringJust as Apple's 
colorful iMacs showed more than a decade ago that personal computers 
don't have to be beige or black, Motorola is moving away from 
traditional black and white. You're still limited to black or white as 
your front color, but you can choose any combination of 18 back cover 
colors and seven "accent" colors, which highlight the power button, 
volume control and the rim of the camera lens. There's more coming: 
Motorola is testing back covers made of wood, for instance, and it plans
 to let people vote on Facebook on future patterns, colors and designs.You
 can choose a custom message for the back of the phone - with limits. I 
tried to enter profanity and trademarked names and was told, "We'd 
rather you not say that." You can use the space to display your email 
address, in case you lose the phone, for instance. In addition, you can 
choose one of 16 wallpapers in advance and enter your Google ID so your 
phone is all set up the first time you turn it on. You can select a 
different custom message to appear on your screen when you turn the 
phone on. You can even choose the color of your charger, white or black.Choose
 carefully, as you won't be able to make changes after a 14-day return 
window. These aren't parts that you can simply pop out and swap.With
 the exception of $50 more for a phone with 32 gigabytes of storage 
rather than 16 gigabytes, there's no cost for the customization. They 
will be available at about the same time the standard white and black 
phones come out in late August or early September. Wood back covers 
aren't expected until later in the year, however.In the 
beginning, you can get custom versions only with AT&T as your 
service provider, but other carriers are coming. Standard versions will 
also be available through Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and U.S. Cellular at
 launch. You do the ordering through Motorola's Moto Maker website, 
which will cover service plan options with AT&T when you order the 
phone. If you walk into an AT&T store, you can pay for it there, 
just like a gift card, but you'll then have to visit the Moto Maker site
 and enter a scratch-off code.So what does all this mean?At
 first, I thought of it as a gimmick. But then I thought more about how 
phones are among our most personal possessions. Your phone contains your
 private thoughts in email, contact information for your loved ones and 
precious memories in the form of photos. So I can understand the desire 
to add a personal touch to the look of your phone, especially if you 
don't have to pay more. Keep in mind that your customizations might make
 the phone harder to resell when you're ready to trade up for a new 
model.In many ways, it's similar to the way desktops and laptops 
have been sold. You can go to Dell's or Apple's website and order any 
number of configurations. The difference is those configurations 
typically have to do with the amount of storage, the speed of the 
processor, the size of the screen and the software that comes with the 
machine. With Moto X, you're getting the same storage choices that other
 phones offer, but all the other options are cosmetic.Meanwhile, 
the Moto X advances hands-free phone use. Although hands-free options 
are available elsewhere to make a call or send a text, Moto X opens the 
door to the entire Web. It relies on Google Now, the virtual assistant 
that retrieves information when you speak into the phone. Normally, you 
press something to activate Google Now. That's how Siri works on iPhones
 as well. With Moto X, you simply say, "OK, Google Now."That 
command is specific to your voice. I asked three colleagues to speak 
"OK, Google Now" into a phone I trained by repeating the phrase three 
times. The phone ignored my colleagues, but responded to me instantly 
once I spoke from the same distance. Sorry, pranksters: You won't be 
able use this feature to set 3 a.m. alarms on your friend's Moto X.I
 was able to get the phone to recognize my command from about 10 feet 
away, as well as close by with an episode of "The Walking Dead" playing 
at full blast on a laptop inches away. But under those conditions, the 
service was more prone to make mistakes. For instance, the phone 
misheard a request for directions to Boston as "directions to fall."Even
 in a quiet room, Google Now made a lot of mistakes responding to 
requests to call specific people. When I asked Google Now to "call Bob,"
 it offered me "Emily," ''Dave" and "Super" - for the superintendent of 
my apartment building, who's not named Bob.I can see this feature
 being useful to motorists, but it's imperfect. And if you protect your 
phone with a PIN code, you'll need to type it in to unlock the phone, 
except to make a call. Motorola says it tried voice recognition for 
passwords, but couldn't get it to work properly.There are two 
things that will work without entering your PIN: You can get a peek at 
text messages and other notifications by pressing the center of the 
screen for a second. If you want to respond or see more, then you'll 
need the PIN. You can also access your camera by twisting the phone like
 opening a doorknob. You can browse through shots you have just taken, 
but you'll need the PIN for older ones.Speaking of the camera, 
Motorola did a good job of keeping it simple. With Samsung's Galaxy S4 
and HTC One, I've often hit the wrong buttons for gimmicky features I 
don't want. With the Moto X, you have to swipe the screen from the left 
to access the settings. That way, the buttons aren't there to hit 
accidently. To access your gallery of photos, you swipe from the right. 
Again, you won't be getting old images accidently and miss the chance to
 snap a new one.The camera also lacks a shutter button. Instead, 
you tap anywhere on the screen to take a photo. Keep pressing on the 
screen, and the camera will take a series of shots in succession.The
 screen measures 4.7 inches diagonally, which is larger than the iPhone 
5's 4 inches and close to the 5 inches found on a few other leading 
phones. Held like a skyscraper, the phone is narrower than most leading 
Android phones. The edges are curved, but the middle is thickened more 
than the typical phone. That actually fits nicely in my hands, as the 
palm isn't flat when in a grip position. It's not heavy either, at 4.6 
ounces.Although Motorola has released other phones since Google 
bought the company in May 2012, the Moto X is the first to be designed 
under Google. It's an impressive offering that could make Motorola a 
contender in phones again. Google's Moto X in pictures
