HTC Desire 820 Review: Several Improvements and One Drawback

A
 phone that was vital in bringing HTC back into the limelight last year was the HTC Desire 816 (Review | Pictures). This 
mid-range phone had a large screen, ran the latest version of Android, 
packed HTC's trademark BoomSound speakers, and boasted of a camera that 
could capture some stunning photographs in the right lighting 
conditions. Six months after the launch of the Desire 816, HTC 
announced its successor - the Desire 820. Apart from subtle aesthetic changes, it has upgraded internal specs such as a new 
future-proof 64-bit octa-core processor, slightly more RAM, more 
internal storage space and a better front camera. Let's dive right in 
and figure out if the Desire 820 will continue to capture the 
attention of buyers looking for a phone in the mid-range segment. Look and feelWe
 noticed that the front of the HTC Desire 820 looks quite similar to its predecessor, with dark borders around the screen and strips on
 the top and the bottom to accommodate the front-firing BoomSound 
speakers. What HTC has done differently this time around is use its industrial design 
expertise to give the Desire 820 an attractive two-tone body. Unfortunately, the glossy plastic looks and feels
 cheap. It attracts fingerprints and scratches very easily. 
We'd suggest using a case with this phone - preferably the Dot View one. The
 Desire 820 reduces the thickness and weight of the Desire 816 by 
0.2mm and 10g respectively. At the same time, it is 
1.1mm taller. These are minor changes, although the lower weight is actually perceptible. It felt rather light in our hands. We
 got the Santorini White variant of the phone for review, which has blue accents around the edges on the front. It 
also has a similar coat of blue paint around the edges of hardware the micro-USB port on the bottom, power button and volume rocker 
on the right, and the camera ring and LED flash on the rear. The
 plastic ring around the lens of the primary camera protrudes from the body to protect the lens. The 3.5mm jack sits on top of the phone. A 
flap on the left covers the two Nano-SIM card slots 
and the microSD card slot.The Taiwanese phone company has decided
 to stick with the same 720p 5.5-inch screen which was used on the Desire 816. We had expected HTC to bump up the 
resolution to 1080p, but HTC phones generally have great displays and the Desire 
820 is no exception. It has good colour reproduction and brilliant viewing angles. 
However, we did feel that the brightness level of this screen was 
slightly on the lower side. Specifications and softwareThis
 is one of the first phones HTC to feature 
Qualcomm's new 64-bit octa-core SoC aimed at mid-range smartphones. The 
Snapdragon 615 uses has four 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 cores and 
four 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53 cores, and includes the new Adreno 405 GPU. HTC 
has bumped up the RAM to 2GB on the Desire 820, from 1.5GB on the Desire
 816. The internal storage, is now a 
respectable 16GB compared to the 8GB ROM on its younger sibling. The 
Desire 820 accepts microSD cards of up to 128GB capacity and you can connect storage devices using the microUSB port which should sort out all 
your storage needs. The Desire 820's front camera has been bumped up
 to 8 megapixels and the primary one on the rear is still a 
13-megapixel shooter with LED flash. The phone can connect to other 
devices over Bluetooth v4.0 and has support for apt-X, which improves the quality of streamed audio. The Desire 820 can connect to LTE networks in India which work on the 2300MHz
 frequency band. Other connectivity options include Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and 
Wi-Fi Direct. Also unchanged from the Desire 816 is the 2600mAh battery.
 HTC's Sense UI 6.0 skin runs on top of Android 4.4.4 and the 
company has promised an update to Android Lollipop in the near future. Of all the Android skins we've seen, Sense UI is the 
lightest. Design-wise it is quite a departure from 
stock Android but it is easy to use. The lock screen shows the home screen dock at 
the bottom, which effectively means that
 you can quickly launch important apps from the lock screen itself. The
 first page of the home screen is the usual Blinkfeed, which is an 
endless scroll of content from your favourite social networking and news
 websites. The app drawer still scrolls vertically, and all apps 
can be arranged by name, order of use, or a custom order 
according to your preference. HTC Zoe, an app used to share 
automatically remixed videos with friends, is also present and it looks 
like HTC engineers are constantly striving to make it a more polished 
experience. HTC also adds a few useful third-party apps like Facebook, 
Polaris Office 5 and WeChat.CameraWe really liked how HTC 
managed to pull a rabbit out of its hat with the performance of the 
primary camera on the Desire 816. For a mid-range smartphone, it had a camera that could even rival some flagship smartphones. Not too 
surprisingly, the Desire 820's 13-megapixel rear camera can capture 
similarly impressive photographs in daylight. Why fix something that 
isn't broken, right? The camera app is very polished and offers
 a smorgasbord of options to the user. It shows only frequently used options by default. There 
are a number of shooting modes available apart from your regular 
suspects like Manual, Auto and Panorama. The Photo Booth mode offers filters, and Depth of Field mode is also one of our favourites. (Click for full size)In our test shots under good lighting conditions we 
noticed that the camera captured great details with the noise levels 
kept to a bare minimum. The images had a warm colour tone, which we 
actually like. However, it may look undersaturated to some people. 
Also, we didn't notice any barrel distortion or chromatic 
aberration. The HDR mode creates some really dramatic improvements to the dynamic range. Compared
 to other phones in the same price range, the Desire 820 can capture 
decent shots even in low-light conditions. While our captured 
images did have noise, there was a good amount of light. The
 Desire 820 can also record really detailed 1080p shots but the 
Slow Motion mode captures only 720p clips which don't look so good.
 The 8-megapixel front camera does capture more details in a selfie than
 the 5-megapixel shooter on the Desire 816 did, but it would have been great
 if the lens had been wider. (Click for full size)PerformanceThe phone screamed 
through any task we threw at it. From running multiple apps to 
performing strenuous tasks like 3D gaming, the Desire 820 was ready and 
raring to go. Unfortunately, as is the case with slim smartphones, all 
this heavy lifting caused the upper half of the phone to heat up. It didn't get unbearably hot, but this has become too common and smartphone companies 
need to find a solution soon.  In our AnTuTu and Quadrant 
benchmarks, the Desire 820 scored 29,020 and 19,213 points respectively,
 which is quite good. The phone 
logged scores of 25fps in GFXbenchmark and 8,964 in 3D Mark Ice Storm. 
It also managed to run all our test videos, including a
 40mbps one, with ease.The BoomSound speakers on the Desire 820 are 
still the best one can find on a smartphone and the sound quality over 
earphones was also pretty good. Call quality was top-notch as usual and 
we have absolutely no qualms about it. The only drawback we found
 with the Desire 820 is its battery life. The 2600mAh battery managed to
 last only 5 hours and 55 minutes in our video loop test, which is 
comparatively very low. Thankfully, the standby time is much better and 
with moderate use we managed to squeeze a day out of the phone. Overall,
 this is a big letdown for the phone. VerdictIn almost 
every way, HTC has improved upon the Desire 816, and created a phone with a more 
attractive design, stellar camera performance, and more power for 
handling all kinds of tasks. But all these perks come at a cost - the battery
 life. If you are planning on buying the Desire 820, we'd suggest 
purchasing a battery pack along with it. There are other options in the same price range
 that you could consider, such as the OnePlus
 One (Review | Pictures), Lenovo Vibe X2 (Review | Pictures) and the 
Gionee Elife S5.1 (Review | Pictures). All these phones have some 
drawbacks but they have at least one redeeming feature that sets them 
apart from the rest. One thing's for sure, we are finding 
it increasingly difficult to pick a favourite in this price range.
