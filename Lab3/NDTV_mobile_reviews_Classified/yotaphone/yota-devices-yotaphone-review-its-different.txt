Yota Devices YotaPhone Review: It's Different

While
 smartphones these days are stuffed to gills with powerful technology, 
design-wise, it would not be far-fetched to state that companies are 
unwilling to push the boundaries and actually take a risk, though recent
 launches like Blackberry Passport (Review | Pictures) and Lenovo Vibe X2 (Review | Pictures) have managed to 
buck that trend. Another exception that particularly caught our fancy is
 the YotaPhone made by a Russian broadband service provider Yota 
Devices. The YotaPhone has what the company claims, "The world's 
first dual-screen smartphone with an always-on display." We are 
definitely intrigued by the ingenuity of this particular device to the 
point that we were left wondering why couldn't someone else think of 
this before!Before we get to the review, do bear in mind that 
this is the first version of the YotaPhone that the company unveiled at 
CES 2012. In India, the YotaPhone is being sold by Jumbo Electronics 
exclusively via Flipkart. It's also worth noting that Yota Devices has 
already unveiled the next iteration of the YotaPhone, which will be 
unsurprisingly called YotaPhone 2, and it is all set for a December 
launch in London. Obviously, the YotaPhone 2 betters it predecessors in a
 lot of ways and we will try to get hands on one when it is launched 
here. But until then, lets find out if the first generation YotaPhone 
still has the chops to create a stir in India. Look and feelWe
 really want to give the YotaPhone full marks for innovation for its 
design because it turned heads every single time we pulled the phone out
 of the pocket. People were curious about the second screen and we were 
happy to oblige with an explanation.The rear of this phone is 
made of 4.3-inch curved e-ink display and if reports are to be believed 
Yota Devices commissioned Corning to create a special curved Gorilla 
Glass 3 to be added for additional protection. The company did this 
right before showcasing the phone at CES 2012. One problem we faced in 
our time with the phone is that the curved rear actually made the phone 
feel bottom heavy. Also, the soft plastic edges around the matte rear 
can't do much to prevent the phone from slipping.This e-ink 
display is not touch sensitive and there is a touch panel right below 
it, which accepts swipes and taps for navigation. The rear camera and 
flash is quite oddly placed at the bottom of the rear (below the 
screen), which is an inconvenience because our fingers invariably 
covered the camera while trying to click a picture. However, this might 
be less of a problem as one uses the YotaPhone for longer durations. 
Additionally, there is a slit for a speaker at the bottom. Turn 
the phone around and things start looking more familiar. The nondescript
 front is dominated by a 4.3-inch screen, with copious bezels 
surrounding all the sides. There is a front camera and an earpiece above
 this screen. Below it lies another touch panel, like the one on its 
rear, which can again be used for navigation. A Micro-USB port lies at 
the bottom and is accompanied by a microphone. The volume rocker lies on
 the left edge of the phone. The power button has curiously been placed 
on the Micro-SIM card tray - it doesn't have good travel and feels very 
soft to use as well. On the top, one can also find the 3.5mm jack and 
another microphone. Dual DisplaysThe main display on the 
YotaPhone is 4.3-inch primary screen IPS LCD panel with a resolution of 
720x1280, which is really good because it translates to a pixel density 
of 342ppi. It is a very crisp display with a good amount of saturation 
but we noticed that the whites had a very warm tone to the extent that 
the screen looked really yellow. The viewing angles were great and the 
sunlight legibility was really good too. All in all, we really liked 
this display.The highlight of the device is of course the rear 
4.3-inch e-ink panel has a display resolution of 360x640 pixels, which 
translates to a pixel density of 170ppi. In comparison, the cheapest 
Amazon Kindle's screen has a pixel density of 167ppi. This screen 
displays 16-grayscale colours just like the display on the Kindle. We 
checked both the screens together and noticed that the Kindle's screen 
was only slightly sharper but the YotaPhone screen still gets the work 
done. We had no problem in sifting through the pages of H.G.Wells'
 classic novel Time Machine thanks primarily to the fact that an e-ink 
display is the only technology at the moment that comes close to 
emulating the characteristics of real paper. The additional benefit is 
that, despite being an always-on display, it actually consumes less 
power than an LCD screen which in turn can help save battery life. Our Amazon
Kindle 
review
 talks about the e-ink displays in general and in more detail.Apps need to
 be updated to utilise this additional display for things other than 
notifications, which are handled by the system software. More on this 
later in this review. Specifications and cameraAccording to
 YotaPhone's official website and Flipkart's online listing of the phone
 it is supposed to be packing a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 SoC clocked at 1.7GHz.
 We generally use a software called CPU-Z to double-check the 
specifications and quite surprisingly it showed that the phone is 
actually using a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro clocked at 1.73GHz. The 
model number it showed was QCT MSM8960 CDP. Incidentally, Yota Devices 
used the Snapdragon S4 Pro in the initial build of the YotaPhone. We got a confirmation from Jumbo 
Electronics that the phone uses the MSM8960 chip but the company 
categorically stated that it is running Snapdragon 400.Â  However, Qualcomm's official website states that the Yotaphone uses a Snapdragon S4 Pro processor (MSM8960 Pro). In any case, we 
have benchmark numbers for our readers in the performance section.The phone has 
2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage space with no provision for 
adding more space using a memory card. YotaPhone has a 13-megapixel rear
 camera and a 1-megapixel front-facing camera. The Micro-SIM card inside
 the phone can connect to 3G networks and LTE as well but it does not 
support the 2.3GHz band on which the Indian networks operate. An 1800mAh
 battery powers the phone.The 13-megapixel rear camera can take 
some decent shots in daylight. We noticed that the images are quite 
sharp and the software processing manages to keep noise at a bare 
minimum. Having said that, we did catch some purple fringing around the 
edges. The lens blows out the highlights but this can be overcome a bit 
using the HDR mode. Weirdly, in the HDR mode we couldn't get the lens to
 autofocus however hard we tried - it's not clear if this is a software 
issues or a problem specific to our unit. (click for full size)In low-light, the camera
 captures images which have a lot of noise to the point we'd suggest not
 using this camera in low-light. The camera app used by the YotaPhone is
 the one Google introduced with its Ice Cream Sandwich update, which we 
personally find unintuitive. Of course this can be easily fixed by 
downloading one of the many third-party apps from Google Play. SoftwareThe
 YotaPhone is running Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, which is quite evidently
 outdated. But, please remember that Yota Devices unveiled the phone in 
2012 and at that time it was running the latest Android 4.1 OS. We are 
unsure if the company has plans to update the software to Android 4.4. 
KitKat or 5.0 Lollipop anytime soon, but it seems highly unlikely at 
this moment considering the YotaPhone 2 is already being prepped for 
launch. The phone is running mostly stock Android save for the inclusion
 of a few apps made for working with the rear screen. Apart from this, 
there is absolutely no bloatware, which is a great thing.Yota 
Devices adds front touch panel in place of buttons. To navigate through 
the OS it makes use of a combination of swipes and taps on this panel. A
 single swipe to the left acts as the Back function while the exact 
opposite can be used to get back Home. Double tapping on the centre 
opens Recents. While both the swipe functions worked absolutely fine 
every single time, finding the sweet spot for double tapping was an 
exercise in frustration - again something that might get better as you 
use the phone everyday. Thankfully, the phone has an option to use 
on-screen capacitive buttons as an alternative but it takes up a bit of 
the screen estate. The touch panel on the rear also works in a 
similar fashion. Swiping to the right or the left unlocks the screen. To
 dismiss a notification one has to swipe to the left. While reading, you
 can swipe left or right to flip through pages. Double tapping on the 
panel opens the wallpaper. Swiping from the top of the front takes a 
screenshot and displays it on the back. The swipes and taps take time to
 register, and there is a perceptible lag that can make it rather 
annoying to use initially. However, e-ink panels are not meant to be as 
touch sensitive as traditional displays, and once you teach yourself not
 to be as demanding, it gets a little better. Still, switching between 
the two displays - one with great touch response, and the other not so 
much - can be a frustrating experience.A few proprietary apps 
that make use of the rear screen are Wallpaper, Organiser, Internet Hub,
 TeachMe, Notepad, Bookmate and MapsWithMe. Wallpaper is, as you'd 
guess, used to change the wallpaper of the display. Organiser is a 
calendar app that can be used to display your daily meetings/tasks on 
the rear screen. One can sift through the days using left/ right swipes 
on the touch panel or clicking the volume rocker. Internet hub is a 
collection of feeds, including Facebook and Twitter feeds, that can be 
displayed on the rear screen.TeachMe is an app that can be used 
to learn languages like Russian, German, Spanish, Italian and a few 
more. Notepad displays your recent notes on the rear screen. Yota 
Devices has tied up with Bookmate to display e-books on the rear screen 
and it comes in quite handy. While we would have really loved an 
integration with Amazon's Kindle app, we know that it is too much to ask
 for. MapsWithMe is probably the most unintuitive app of the lot and we 
struggled to use it while on the move. However, if you are going on a 
long drive and will need to be seeing maps along the way with minimal 
interaction, it's great to have an option to view them on a display that
 uses minimal battery rather than a conventional one.The e-ink display can also show incoming notifications but they aren't actionable because of the lack of a touchscreen. PerformanceKeeping
 the benchmark numbers aside for a bit, we think the phone was generally
 zippy to use and it can even play the latest high-end games smoothly 
without any lags. We tried Dead Trigger 2 and Shadowgun, and both the 
games worked flawlessly, thanks to the presence of the fairly powerful 
Adreno 320 GPU. This is further corroborated by the GFXbench and 3D Mark
 Ice Storm (<=720p) tests in which YotaPhone achieved scores of 
24.7fps and 9,957 respectively. In AnTuTu 5 and Quadrant the phone 
managed to log 26,900 and 6,835 respectively. Please note that these 
numbers are indicative of the MSM8960 chip inside the phone. The 
phone also played all our test videos, which also included a highly 
encoded 40mbps file, without skipping frames or any lag. The bundled 
headset sounds fine for most purposes but using a better pair is 
advisable. The speakers are adequately loud and don't crackle at maximum
 volume. The sound quality in calls is pretty good and we didn't face 
any call drops either. In our battery test the phone lasted us 5 hours 
and 46 minutes, which is pretty average by any standards. If users can 
find a way to use the rear screen effectively then they can definitely 
squeeze more juice out of the inbuilt battery. VerdictIn 
our opinion, the first generation YotaPhone is high on innovation but 
the execution could've been better. Like we mentioned before, we like 
the e-ink display for reading books, but we wish there were more apps 
that could use the same. It's especially difficult to recommend the 
YotaPhone when a better device is around the 
corner, where Yota Devices is likely to address at least some of the 
shortcomings of the device.Despite the innovation, the first generation
 YotaPhone feels more like an experiment, an experiment we cannot 
recommend as a purchase unless you are in an absolute urgency to buy a 
phone with an e-ink display and cannot wait for the YotaPhone 2 to hit 
Indian markets. The rest can probably pick up a Moto G (Gen 2) and an 
Amazon Kindle for the e-ink display.
