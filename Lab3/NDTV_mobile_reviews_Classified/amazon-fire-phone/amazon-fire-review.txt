Amazon Fire Review

What I find fascinating about Amazon's Fire phone isn't 
the gizmos such as the 3-D imagery or the camera scanner that helps you 
get more information about products.Rather, I like that Amazon is thinking a lot about how phones ought to work.The
 iPhone and its Android smartphone rivals are so much alike that 
companies have been suing each other for stealing ideas. The Fire phone 
uses Android, but Amazon has modified it to the point that it's barely 
recognizable.That means the phone offers new ways to navigate, 
discover and, of course, shop - all enabled by new features from the 
world's largest online retailer.That doesn't mean everyone should rush out to get a Fire phone.Many
 apps available for iPhones, Android and even Windows Phones aren't 
available for the Fire yet. Some features didn't work as well as I 
anticipated. I couldn't use the Fire's Siri-like voice search to get 
weather or directions, for instance. And when I used Amazon's Maps app 
to get directions to the U.S. Capitol, I got the town of Capitol, 
Montana. Talk about getting lost.Amazon may fix some of these 
issues by the time the phone ships Thursday, and other fixes will likely
 come through future software updates, but consider that it took 
Amazon's tablet computer two years to become a strong contender to 
Apple's iPad.The Fire has a 13-megapixel camera and a screen that measures 4.7 inches diagonally, a comfortable size for one-handed use.It's
 available in the U.S. through AT&T starting at $200 with a two-year
 contract and $650 without one. That's on par with other high-end 
phones, plus you get double the storage and a free year of Amazon's 
Prime membership with Fire. Still, Amazon.com Inc. has typically 
undercut rivals on just about anything else sold on this planet.Price parity could make it tough for Amazon to compete in a crowded smartphone market, despite these features:Dynamic PerspectiveUsing
 four infrared cameras, the phone gauges where your head is and redraws 
images on the screen continually so they appear 3-D.Beyond 
aesthetics, the technology lets you tilt the phone slightly for more 
information, such as Yelp ratings on nearby restaurants. If the 
information is covering up, say, a street name on a map, just tilt it 
away.With tilts, you can scroll down as you read news articles or
 switch between the front and back of dresses when shopping. You can 
control game characters without touching the screen. Swivel the phone as
 though you're turning a doorknob to unveil a menu of options or 
supplemental information such as song lyrics.Developers of 
non-Amazon apps will have to enable the feature, so with eBay's shopping
 app, you still need to swipe to see the other side of a dress.The
 gestures also take getting used to. I got frustrated when the swivels 
didn't work; turned out my motion was too slow. And in testing out the 
gestures, I somehow placed separate orders for a $109 camera and a $150 
hard drive accessory, thanks to a one-click shopping feature. It took an
 hour to notice the first errant order. Fortunately, I was able to 
cancel both in time.FireflyA side button launches the 
Firefly scanning app, which recognizes bar codes, business cards and 
various products. Firefly also recognizes sound, including songs and 
scenes in movies and TV shows.Once there's a match, you can 
swivel the phone to buy an item through Amazon, add a phone number to 
your contacts app or learn more about a movie through Amazon's IMDb.I
 found only four non-Amazon apps that have enabled Firefly. So after 
scanning the movie poster for "Stranger by the Lake," I could launch the
 Flixster app for more information, but I couldn't go directly to 
Netflix because that app hasn't enabled the feature yet.Firefly 
is more comprehensive and reliable than other scanning apps I've tried. I
 was surprised it managed to identify the model of the landline phone on
 my desk. For magazines, it identified specific issues, not just the 
title. But there are still mistakes, such as my laptop's keyboard being 
identified as headphone amplifiers.Mayday helpIntroduced
 with the Kindle Fire HDX tablets last fall, Mayday provides live 
technical support around the clock. The tech adviser who appears on your
 phone can hear you, see your screen and draw marks to show you where to
 press or swipe.This feature works well on the tablet, but as 
helpful as the advisers try to be, they are still getting used to the 
phone. One directed me to Apple's support forums to figure out how to 
transfer iPhone contacts even though Amazon's website had step-by-step 
instructions. The advisers are also learning how to guide you on tilting
 or swiveling.Once these are worked out, though, it should reduce requests for help you get from tech-challenged friends.The carouselMost
 phones have home pages filled with icons to various apps. The Fire 
shows just one at a time, based on what you've recently done. Swipe left
 or right to get the others.These icons do more than take you to 
apps. Some are for specific content, such as a recent book or video. 
Some app icons also preview content underneath, so you can delete an 
email or see a news headline without opening the app.Apps for 
various Amazon services, such as e-books, audiobooks, music and video, 
have been designed to work with the carousel, so watching one movie will
 give you recommendations for others.The Fire is a good start at 
offering a fresh approach to smartphones. More outside apps will need to
 take advantage of the innovations for the phone to be useful beyond 
people who already use Amazon services extensively.
