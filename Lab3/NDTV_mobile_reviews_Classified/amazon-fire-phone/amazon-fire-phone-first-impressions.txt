Amazon Fire Phone: First Impressions

Amazon set out to do something different with the unveiling of 
its first smartphone Wednesday. How about a completely new way of 
interacting with your phone, for starters?As part of the showcase
 of its brand new "Fire Phone," Amazon.com Inc. took the wraps off a 
feature it calls "dynamic perspective." Turns out, it's more than just a
 gimmick that allows you to see in 3-D.The feature makes use of 
four infrared cameras pointed at your face that help judge whether 
you're looking at the screen straight-on, at an angle and how close you 
are to the screen. The phone can then adjust the image accordingly. That
 gives you the ability to see depth in images, to see around objects in 
the foreground, to zoom in for a better look, and to toggle through 
websites, books and menus and even to play games by tilting the phone 
back and forth and up and down while you look at it.Another 
feature called "Firefly" brings what's known as augmented reality to 
life in a new way, by turning your phone into a powerful tool that 
recognizes book covers, CDs, DVDs, songs, movies, grocery items, phone 
numbers and websites and pulls them into the phone so you can take 
action.For Amazon, the major benefit of this is that it takes 
price comparison shopping to a new level, because any item you see while
 walking down the aisle of a Wal-mart or Target can get an instant price 
check. Amazon says the phone can recognize more than a hundred million 
items. And if you link your credit card information to the service, you 
can make a purchase with a couple taps.But more than that, by 
releasing these tools to developers, Amazon has made what could be a 
major contribution to what a smartphone can do.With about a half hour to try out these features and have them explained in depth, I was both impressed and saw some flaws.The
 3-D effect is quite stunning. Just imagine looking down a long hallway 
and putting your ear against each wall one after the other. Your 
perspective changes and straight lines will seem to disappear to a 
different point. To demonstrate the effect on the phone, Amazon made 
available a bunch of lock-screen images, like the cartoon ruins of a 
pyramid, some hot-air balloons and a jungle setting. Swiveling the phone
 around makes it seem like the images had a depth of an inch or two, 
allowing you to look around and beyond objects in the foreground.It's
 a neat party trick but the tool has other uses. Amazon demonstrated an 
early version of how the feature is used in an app by the real estate 
website Zillow, for example. After zooming in on an interior photo, the 
app then allows you to change your perspective of what you're looking at
 inside the room. Sure, it was a bit grainy, and the image wasn't 
rendered in 3-D, but it showed the promise of what's possible.Games
 also made use of the tool. One game allowed you to control whether the 
figure flew up or down based on essentially nodding your head or making 
the phone lie flat or upright. Another game, called Tofu Fury, allows 
you to get a 3-D perspective on the game level. It still essentially 
plays like Angry Birds, but it did something I've never seen before in a
 game.One other neat thing: it does all this in relation to your 
face. So you could do this lying in bed or hanging upside down. I tried 
it out, taking a deep bow. The aforementioned game flew just the same 
depending on where the phone was to my face.Where the feature 
needs work, I felt, was in its ability to control menus and scroll 
through text. Quick side swivels brought up hidden menus on certain 
screens. Like on the music screen, a quick swivel to the left brought up
 a panel from the right side that showed song lyrics. A quick swivel 
while in the second-screen TV watching app, X-Ray, toggled between 
character photos when they were in costume and in street clothes. In the
 maps app, a quick swivel brought up local Yelp listings for 
restaurants. When on a website, tilting the phone away from you makes 
the words scroll up. Tilt it more, and they move even faster.In a
 way, these operational functions made me feel uneasy because I don't 
want to necessarily keep my head still while using my phone all the 
time, or set off unintended actions. And these things were definitely 
possible. While looking at a product image on the Amazon store app of a 
bottled product that was identified using Firefly, the image erratically
 jumped between big and small. I just wanted it to stop.This 
phone has other features, and basically it's very nicely built. It has a
 solid heft in the hand while not being heavy at all. The buttons, which
 can activate the camera or Firefly from a cold start, are minimalist 
and comfortable. The 4.7-inch screen with a 16:9 aspect ratio is just 
right for holding and controlling with one hand. There are speakers on 
top and bottom for stereo sound when holding the phone sideways.And
 it is packed with many of the features that Kindle Fire tablet users 
are familiar with, such as its Mayday live-help function. It is a tool 
for reaping all of the benefits of a $99-a-year Amazon Prime membership,
 from video watching to music listening to book reading. And you get one
 year of Prime for free.Yet it's the dynamic perspective feature 
that, in my view, changes smartphones forever. It's one that others may 
try to copy, and I think it opens up a world of possibilities for app 
developers.Before the event, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos sent all 
attendees a copy of his favorite children's book, "Mr. Pine's Purple 
House." The moral of the story is that it's good to be different 
sometimes.In an interview with The Associated Press after the 
event, Bezos responded to several questions surrounding Amazon's late 
entry into smartphones and the dominance of existing players like Apple 
and Samsung. Bezos rebutted: "Taken to its logical extension, you could 
never have new entrants in anything," and laughed with his signature 
guffaw.This is a purple house and inside there are 3-D images in 
floating picture frames of tofu sculptures suspended by hot-air 
balloons. Many people will want to live there and it's absolutely worth 
taking a tour.
