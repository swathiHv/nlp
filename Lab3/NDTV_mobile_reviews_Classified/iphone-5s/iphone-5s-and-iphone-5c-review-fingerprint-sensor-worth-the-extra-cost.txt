iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c review: Fingerprint sensor worth the extra cost

Passcodes are such a pain that I've relaxed the security settings on my 
Android phone. I'm willing to forgo the extra safety, just so I'm asked 
to punch in the code less often. When I got my hands on Apple's new 
iPhone 5s, one of the first things I tried was a feature that allows you
 to bypass the passcode using a fingerprint.I had a lot of fun unlocking the phone over and over again. Who knew biometric authentication could be such a blast?The
 fingerprint sensor alone is worth the extra $100 you'll pay for the iPhone 5s 
over an iPhone 5c. Both phones will come out Friday. In the week I've 
had with both, I've also been impressed with the better camera and 
slow-motion video in the 5s.The 5c, meanwhile, is largely last 
year's iPhone 5 with a plastic casing instead of aluminum and glass. 
This isn't cheap plastic, but a type offering the slippery feel of a 
shiny ceramic tile. It comes in five colors.(Also see: Apple unveils iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s)Both phones come with
 iOS 7, the most radical change to Apple's operating system software for
 mobile devices since its 2007 debut. Many of the changes are cosmetic, 
but there are functional improvements such as easier access to 
frequently used settings and apps.I will review iOS 7 separately.
 Many existing iPhone users won't need more than the free update, which 
is available starting Wednesday. Neither the 5c nor the 5s offers 
improvements on the screen size, which remains at 4 inches (10 
centimeters) diagonally. But new features and new colors may draw you to
 one of these new iPhones.iPhone 5s (available in silver, gold or gray; starts at $199 with two-year service contract, or $649 without a contract)When
 you set up the 5s, you're asked to tap the home button with a finger 
several times so the phone can create a mathematical representation of 
your print. To unlock the phone, you simply tap the home button, and the
 phone will compare the two taps. You can tap from any angle, even 
sideways or upside down. This fingerprint ID also works as a way to 
authenticate the purchase of apps and content within apps.For 
security reasons, there are still times you'll need your four-digit 
passcode, including after 48 hours of inactivity and before adding a new
 fingerprint. If the phone fails to recognize your print, you can always
 use the passcode. I had trouble only when my fingers were wet or 
greasy. One evening, I ordered pizza with an oily pepperoni topping and 
ate it without a napkin. The fingerprint sensor worked after one slice, 
but not two. Indian naan bread also threw off the sensor.(Also see: 10 new features in Apple's iPhone 5s)Apple 
says it stores the print data on your phone, in a place that's 
inaccessible to other apps or to Apple's remote servers. The company 
also says it's not possible to convert a fingerprint from a police file 
into something the phone will recognize, as the sensor reads a 
sub-epidermal layer of the finger. And the finger needs to be live - 
cutting off a thumb won't work.I'm convinced Apple has given a 
lot of thought to security. If you're still uneasy about the fingerprint
 scan, you can stick with the passcode. The feature is optional.Meanwhile,
 the 5S's camera takes better night and indoor shots. Although the main 
camera remains at 8 megapixels, individual pixels are larger and thus 
better at sensing light. The camera's shutter also opens wider to let in
 more light. For flash shots, the camera fires two bursts of light at 
once, each slightly different in color. The iPhone adjusts the 
combination of the two colors automatically to match ambient lighting.I
 typically avoid using the flash in any camera because its strong burst 
of whitish light overpowers whatever's in the room. In a hallway with 
strong yellow light, for instance, the flashes on my high-end camera and
 the iPhone 5 made the walls white. The 5s, on the other hand, managed 
to preserve the yellow. I also got better skin tones on some flash shots
 taken with the 5s. Using the 5c, faces and arms looked more pale.Night
 shots without the flash are also sharper. Sometimes, cameras 
overcompensate for low light by making the few points of light too 
bright. The 5s typically has those scenes properly balanced.Of 
course, these improvements won't make all photos better. Many shots 
appear the same whether taken with the 5, the 5c or the 5s. In other 
shots, differences are subtle.The 5s can also shoot slow motion 
video. You can choose the parts you want in slow motion and regular 
speed, and you can change your mind later. A burst mode lets you snap 
100 shots in 10 seconds, compared with 40 seconds on the 5c. The phone 
picks out the best moments and filters out duplicates. The front-facing 
camera is better than the one on previous iPhones. It has larger pixels 
for low-light videoconferencing.Many of these features are 
possible because of Apple's faster A7 processor. A companion chip, the 
M7, handles motion-related data without draining as much of the battery,
 something useful for fitness trackers. All this power is so new, apps 
taking advantage of them weren't available for me to test.iPhone5c (available in green, blue, yellow, pink or white; starts at 
$99 with two-year service contract, or $549 without a contract)Plastic
 colors aside, the 5c is mostly the same as the iPhone 5 it replaces, 
with the older A6 chip and a main camera that's not as good in low 
light. Because the chip is slower, it couldn't do slow-motion video or 
take as many shots per second. But it does have the 5s's improved 
front-facing camera.The 5c is for those who really want the 
bright color. If you can afford the additional $100 and can do with 
silver, gold or gray, get the 5s instead. The fingerprint sensor will 
make security less annoying, and the better camera will be more useful 
in documenting life. A hundred dollars isn't that much when you compare 
it with the full price of the phone. iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s launch in pictures
