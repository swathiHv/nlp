HTC Desire 616 and One (E8): First Impressions

HTC on Friday launched two new Android smartphones 
in India, the HTC Desire 616 Dual SIM and HTC One (E8) Dual SIM, priced 
at Rs. 16,900 and Rs. 34,990 respectively. The company has high hopes 
for the two models, as they are both variations of recently launched 
popular models. The Desire 616 Dual SIM is the smaller sibling of the 
HTC Desire 816 (Review | Pictures) while the One (E8) Dual SIM is a low-cost, fashionable 
variant of the HTC One (M8).Last month, HTC had announced
 the single-SIM variant of the HTC One (E8) suggesting that a dual-SIM 
version would be launched in some regions. The HTC Desire 616 Dual SIM
 was earlier launched in Singapore this month.We at NDTV Gadgets 
got a chance to spend some time with both HTC smartphones at the 
company's India launch event, and these are our first impressions.HTC Desire 616 Dual SIMThe
 mid-range Desire 616 Dual SIM is a smaller version of the recently 
launched
 HTC Desire 816, which costs Rs. 23,990.The HTC Desire 616 Dual SIM 
has a 5-inch display size and still fit well in our hands. The 
smartphone is made of plastic, and its removable glossy back panel is a 
fingerprint magnet (see above). The build of the phone is pretty decent,
 and apart from its glossy body, the device felt quite premium.HTC
 has fit in the display quite well, and the Desire 616 Dual SIM looks 
great with its nearly invisible side bezels. The device has a 5-inch 
display with an HD (720x1280 pixels) resolution that works out to a 
density 294 pixels per inch. In our limited time with the phone, we 
found that HTC hasn't compromised on build quality. The only real 
problem is that fingerprints really do stand out.The display 
looked fine indoors but outdoor reflectiveness was a bit too much. We 
couldn't play videos on it in the limited time we had, but images looked
 good on screen. We will test the display in our detailed review, 
including its viewing angles, video playback capabilities and more.(Also see: HTC Desire 616 Dual SIM: First look in pictures)HTC
 has gone with a Mediatek MT6592 octa-core SoC clocked at 1.4GHz for 
Desire 616 Dual SIM, coupled with 1GB of RAM. We were expecting exciting
 performance here, but we were a bit disappointed. We didn't try any 
heavy games, considering that even switching between apps on the Desire 
616 Dual SIM took quite a bit of time. The device would undoubtedly have
 done better with 2GB RAM, but considering that even the more expensive 
Desire 816 has 1.5GB of RAM, this is what we get for the price.The
 Desire 616 has an 8-megpixel autofocus camera with LED flash that is 
capable of recording full-HD (1080p) videos, as well as a front-facing 
2-megapixel camera with HD (720p) video recording. We took a few images 
indoors and outdoors, and they were pretty decent on the HD screen. 
Low-light images that we took didn't impress us though. Overall, it 
seems that the camera is nothing really special. HTC One (E8) Dual SIMThe
 HTC One (E8) Dual SIM is a plastic version of the premium HTC One (M8) 
which was launched
 in India at Rs. 49,900.From the front, the E8 looks nearly 
identical to the M8, but when we turned the phone around, we really saw 
where the differences lie. Since the HTC One (E8) Dual SIM was meant to 
be a cheaper variant of the HTC One (M8) (Review | Pictures), it doesn't have the unique Duo 
Camera setup. HTC has instead gone with a more traditional 13-megapixel 
rear camera with BSI sensor and LED flash. The front-facing camera is 
the same 5-megapixel unit as the one on the M8.  Also, all other 
specifications of the One (E8) Dual SIM are the same as those of the HTC
 One (M8), except that it offers dual-SIM support. It is 0.5mm thicker 
and 0.1mm taller than the One (M8), but weighs 15 grams less because of 
its plastic body.We missed the Duo Camera feature. The images we 
captured in indoor lighting seemed a bit worse than those we've taken 
with the HTC One (M8)'s 4-UltraPixel camera. Since the E8 is still a 
premium smartphone by Indian pricing standards, we expected better from 
the 13-megapixel camera. Images taken with the flash in dim light were a
 bit grainy too.The smartphone comes in three colours - Polar 
White, Electric Crimson and Misty Grey - out which the grey version has a
 matte rear panel while other two are glossy.  The polycarbonate body 
has the same curves as the M8's metal body does, and it feels quite nice
 in hand.The One (E8) Dual SIM has a 5-inch full-HD SLCD 3 
display and runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat with HTC Sense UI 6 on top. Just 
like the M8, the E8 is powered by a 2.5GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon
 801 processor and has 2GB of RAM. The device didn't feel sluggish in 
our limited testing time, and in that regard it lived up to our 
expectations. Multi-tasking seemed smooth, and there were no problems 
with touch sensitivity either. Apps opened and closed fairly 
instantaneously.Stay tuned for more detailed observations and comprehensive test results in our full reviews of both devices.  HTC One (E8) Dual SIM: First look
