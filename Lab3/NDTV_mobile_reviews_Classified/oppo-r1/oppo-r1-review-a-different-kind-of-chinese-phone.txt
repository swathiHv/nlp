Oppo R1 Review: A Different Kind of Chinese Phone

Oppo made a bit of a splash when it entered India with
 the N1, a relatively premium phone with a unique swivelling camera, but
 it will take a lot more than one model and a few splashy ads for the 
company to establish itself in India. As an unknown brand with an 
unproven after-sales service track record, Oppo has a tough fight ahead 
of it - but if it does manage, the rewards of success in India's booming
 smartphone market will be rich.Besides the N1, the second prong 
of Oppo's attack is the new R1. This model is quite different from its 
predecessor, and will probably appeal to a wider section of buyers. It's
 a simple, sleek slab of a phone but promises quite a few features that 
should make it stand out.Look and feelThe Oppo R1 has a 
definite iPhone 4 vibe. The proportions are different, but the overall 
look of the front, back and sides are more than a little inspired by 
Apple's previous-generation design style. The front and back are sheer 
glass, and are in fact so reflective that even though they're black, you
 could easily use either as a mirror and clearly see every pore on your 
face.This also makes the phone extremely slippery. More than 
once, we caught it sliding around on various surfaces we left it on, and
 on one occasion a gust of wind actually managed to nudge it a little 
way when it was lying on a table. This is definitely not the easiest 
phone to hold, and you'll want to be careful if you have sweaty hands.The
 high-gloss surfaces don't get scratched during everyday usage, but they
 definitely do pick up smudges and fingerprints like crazy. The R1 comes
 with a snap-on plastic case which helps with the grip and smudges, but 
covers probably the most attractive parts of the phone. The front
 has no visible markings except for very faint icons beneath the screen 
where the capacitive buttons are. They light up a little when the screen
 is on, but you'll be tapping them more by memory than by sight. There's
 a silver Oppo logo on the upper back and a silver ring around the 
camera lens, but the rest of the rear panel is quite blank.The 
power button is on the upper left with the volume rocker opposite it on 
the right. Towards the lower left corner is a neatly designed SIM card 
tray that sits perfectly flush with the phone's exterior, but actually 
has cavities for two Micro-SIMs. There's no microSD slot though.The
 design is very slick, and the R1 feels rather premium. Unlike our 
stereotypical ideas of Chinese-branded phones, this one definitely 
doesn't feel as though it might break or fall apart in a few months' 
time.Features and softwareThe R1's interiors definitely 
aren't as premium as its exterior. The processor is a relatively weak 
MediaTek MT6582 with four cores running at 1.3GHz and a Mali-400. 
There's 1GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage space, which is divided 
into "system storage" and "phone storage". Around 11GB is available to 
the user in total. The screen is bright and crisp, and although 
we've seen full-HD resolutions at this size, 720x1280 should be sharp 
enough for most people. Everything else is fairly standard, though 
Bluetooth is strangely stuck at version 2.1, which won't play well with 
many of today's popular low-energy accessories.The bigger story 
is the software. The R1 runs Android 4.2.2 but comes with Oppo's fairly 
extensive skin, which for some reason is called ColorOS. Unlike most 
third-party skins, this one is actually quite well designed. We wish the
 underlying version of Android was more modern, but there's nothing 
wrong with the skin itself. It's easy enough to find your way around if 
you have even a passing familiarity with Android.You can have a 
number of home screens and populate them with icons and widgets as 
usual, but you can also turn on the Photo Space and Music Space, which 
then live to the right of your home screens. Photo Space contains a 
large camera widget which acts like a mini camera app when tapped, and 
lets you take photos right then and there without even launching into 
the camera app. The rest of the screen is a timeline of photos you've 
already taken. Music Space only displays a turntable-styled music player
 which you can tap to begin or pause music playback, or swipe to move 
between tracks. Both "spaces" have a row of shortcut buttons to related 
apps and actions, as well as a row of four additional configurable 
shortcuts. The home screen customisation menu promises that more 
such "Exclusive spaces" are coming soon. Here you can also find options 
for live wallpaper which can change as per the current weather. These 
are extremely gimmicky; for example icons flash when there's a random 
lightning strike on the "Thundershowers" wallpaper.The rest of 
the UI is clean and sensible, with surprisingly little junk. There are a
 few pointless apps such as Lock Now which does nothing but lock the 
screen, and Power Manager, which duplicates the Battery page from the 
Settings app. Data Saving is potentially more useful, allowing you to 
track and block apps that use your 3G or Wi-Fi connections in the 
background. Guest Mode lets you hide contacts, photos, videos and apps, 
and Holiday Mode disables notifications for incoming calls and messages 
except those from contacts you whitelist.There's also O-Cloud, a 
backup service for contacts and messages that you can register for, and 
the handy Kingsoft Office suite. Chrome is the default browser.Oppo
 includes a number of tweaks, such as gestures that you can make to 
trigger screenshots, adjust the volume and jump to the camera app from 
any part of the OS. When the R1 is in standby mode, you can double-tap 
to turn the screen on, or draw gestures to trigger the flashlight or 
camera app.The gestures idea carries over to a dedicated panel 
that you can pull down from the upper left corner of the status bar at 
any time. Here you can even configure your own shortcut gestures for 
things such as calling a particular contact, launching an app, loading a
 website, etc.CameraOppo is seriously hyping the R1's 
camera, especially its capabilities in low light. Its website boasts 
that the camera sensor measures 1/3.2 of an inch, which is 
characteristic of a few older high-end phones which are still fairly 
premium today. Combined with the f/2.0 aperture and back-side sensor 
illumination, this should allow for fairly decent low-light shots.The
 camera app is fairly well designed, and you get basic options for 
things such as the photo and video resolution, timer, location tagging 
and white balance. There are a few "scene modes too" - landscape, 
sunset, night, sports, and portrait - but no HDR.(Click to see full size)Photos came out 
with mixed results. We noticed some odd behaviour when trying to focus, 
when the camera simply refused to focus on what was in front of it and 
instead decided that the background needed to be sharp. Other times, we 
were impressed with the clarity of subjects, especially finer details 
such as the veins in leaves.The much-touted night photography 
abilities also turned out to be something of a mixed bag. While photos 
definitely had a lot of detail, they also had way too much noise. 
Subjects close at hand and lit by artificial light fared better, but 
there was still much more noise than we would have liked.We took 
some video at night as well, and found that it was surprisingly clear. 
Moving cars were well defined and noise was manageable. (Click to see full size)PerformanceWe
 had no problem with lags in everyday usage, but this phone definitely 
wasn't meant to handle full-HD video. Some of our clips played with 
occasional stutters, but the heavier ones didn't even load. Similarly, 
gaming is restricted to casual titles only. Games like Temple Run 2 look
 fantastic, but that's as good as you should expect things to be.Call
 quality is perfectly acceptable and we were also pretty impressed with 
the built-in speaker when playing music and watching video clips. The R1
 is one of the better-sounding smartphones though of course that isn't 
saying very much. The battery lasted 6 hours, 12 minutes in our video loop test, which is acceptable but not very reassuring.Benchmark scores were mostly predictable. The 
Oppo R1 managed to post some of the lowest scores we've seen in a long 
time when it came to the graphics test, but did manage to hold its own 
in CPU-bound tests. You can definitely get better raw performance at 
this price point, so you'll have to seriously consider whether your 
priority is a phone that looks good or one that has more muscle.VerdictThe
 Oppo R1 looks great, and if you don't see the appeal in running lots of
 apps or carrying a lot of media around with you, then you'll probably 
like it. You can do all the basics, including surf the Web and use as 
many messenger and social networking apps as you like, but you won't get
 far if you try gaming or doing any serious work. At this price 
level, the Oppo R1 competes with several strong devices such as the Motorola 
Moto X (review), Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (review), HTC Desire 816 (review) and Sony Xperia 
T2 Ultra (review). The R1 might be the best looking of this bunch, but it 
definitely suffers in terms of features and flexibility. There's also 
the fact that Oppo doesn't have the kind of brand pull that any of these
 competitors do, and its service network is not yet proven. Oppo 
might have to drop prices to be competitive in this context. The R1 is 
much more reassuring than many of the phones sold by Indian brands which
 are of unknown origin, so maybe that's where the company should focus 
its attention rather than the premium segment.Oppo R1 in pictures
