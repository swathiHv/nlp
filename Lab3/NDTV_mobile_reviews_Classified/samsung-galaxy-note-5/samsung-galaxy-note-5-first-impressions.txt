Samsung Galaxy Note 5: First Impressions

Samsung's first oversized smartphone, the original Samsung Galaxy Note, 
was launched back in 2011 at the IFA exhibition in Berlin. The South 
Korean company has launched a new Note model at the same show every year
 until last year. This year, Samsung unveiled the new Samsung Galaxy 
Note 5 at its own Galaxy Unpacked 2015 event in New York where it also 
revealed the new Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+. The company hasn't given any 
specific reason why the Galaxy Note 5 was launched a little early, 
though several reports claimed it to be a move to make sure the new devices are in the 
market ahead of Apple's next iPhones.While we can't say as of now 
whether the move has given Samsung a head start against Apple's new 
iPhones, due to launch on Wednesday, both the Galaxy Note 5 and the 
Galaxy S6 Edge+ have surely made the premium-end segment seem 
interesting. As hinted last month at the India launch of the Galaxy S6 
Edge+ (First Impressions), Samsung has just launched its new Note-series smartphone, the 
Galaxy Note 5, in India. On being asked how it plans to convince loyal 
Galaxy Note customers to upgrade to the new Galaxy Note 5, Samsung India
 at the launch was confident that the new Note brings plenty of 
improvements over its predecessors.At the launch, we got to spend
 a little time with the new Galaxy Note 5. The new Note model will be 
available in India in three colour options: Black Sapphire, Gold 
Platinum, and Silver Titanium. We got a Silver Titanium model to play 
around with.The Galaxy Note 5 is comfortable to hold but is 
barely usable with just one hand, thanks to its big 5.7-inch screen. The
 first thing we noticed when we held the new Galaxy Note 5 was its metal
 frame. Much like the Samsung Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, and Galaxy S6 
Edge+, the metal rim on the Galaxy Note 5 curves fluidly so that it is 
wider on the top and bottom and narrower on the sides. Since the launch 
of its Galaxy Alpha smartphone, Samsung has been using metal frames on 
many of its premium handsets including the Galaxy Note 4 (Review | Pictures). However, we 
can definitely say that compared to its predecessor, the Galaxy Note 5 
feels sturdier.The usual textured rear panel has been replaced 
with an all-glass look. Similar to the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, the
 Note 5's body colour is visible through the back panel. The back panel 
of the Note 5 is very shiny and reflective, making it hard for us to 
photograph it without reflections, something we also pointed out in our 
Galaxy S6 Edge review. Despite this, we were confident of using the device without it 
slipping, unlike the Galaxy S6 Edge and Galaxy S6 Edge+ which have very 
slippery rear panels.Samsung's traditional physical home button, 
which has now become an integral part of almost every Galaxy device, 
sits right below the display, with the fingerprint reader embedded into 
its surface. The capacitive Back and Recents buttons sit on either side 
of the Home button. The power button can be found on the right while the
 volume rocker is on the left.The placement of the LED flash 
accompanied and the heart rate sensor has been changed in the new Note. 
Both are now placed next to the camera. In the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, they were 
placed right below the camera.The S Pen stylus can be pulled out of a 
silo on the bottom of the Note 5, and features a one-click eject 
mechanism. The Micro-USB port and 3.5mm audio jack are also on the 
bottom.The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 features a 5.7-inch QHD 
(1440x2560-pixel) Super-AMOLED screen with a pixel density of 515ppi, 
which is the same as that of the Galaxy Note 4. The display looks bright
 with satisfactory colour reproduction. The viewing angles and 
visibility under direct indoor lighting were good. The phone is powered 
by a 64-bit octa-core Exynos 7420 chipset with four Cortex-A57 cores 
clocked at 2.1GHz and four Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.5GHz, coupled 
with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. Samsung has used its in-house Exynos 7420 SoC in
 all of its high-end smartphones launching this year.  The Galaxy Note 4
 was powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 805 processor.In our 
limited time spent with the handset, we observed that it handled 
multitasking and Internet browsing pretty easily without any lag. We 
will reserve our verdict on Samsung Galaxy Note 5's performance until we
 get a chance to put it through its paces for a detailed review.The
 company has launched 32GB and 64GB models in India. Unfortunately, 
Samsung declined to comment on whether or not there's any chance that 
the 128GB model will be available. It was briefly listed by the company following its Galaxy Unpacked event. The Galaxy Note 5
 has no microSD card slot, and features a non-removable 3,000mAh 
battery.The Galaxy Note 5 runs its own custom UI on top of the 
Android 5.1 Lollipop. We were unable to find many of the usual features 
of Google's stock Android Lollipop experience on the handset. The new UI
 however feels more fresh and light than previous versions of TouchWiz, 
which has had its share of controversy in the past.(Also see: Why Microsoft's Push Into Google's Android Is Good News for Users)One of the most interesting moves Samsung has made
 is the bundling of Microsoft's suite of apps. One can find Office apps 
such as Excel, OneNote, OneDrive, PowerPoint, Skype, and Word. Much like
 recently launched high-end Galaxy devices, the new Note 5 also offers 
consumers 100GB of free OneDrive cloud storage free for two years.The S Pen stylus features remain central
 to the Galaxy Note 5's software. The Air Command option, which pops up 
when a user hovers over the home screen with the S-Pen, shows options 
for Action Memo, Smart Select, Screen Write, and S Note tools. Users can
 add more shortcuts, if required, to the launcher. Most of the apps on 
the Galaxy Note 5 looked much the same as on the Galaxy Note 4.Samsung
 India at the launch stressed heavily on its new Fast Charging 
technology, which allows the new Note 5 charge fully in roughly 90 
minutes with the regular wired charger, or 120 minutes wirelessly. A 
recent test also showed that Samsung devices do charge quickly in short periods of time.The
 Galaxy Note 5 sports a 16-megapixel rear camera with f/1.9 aperture and
 optical image stabilisation, as well as a 5-megapixel front-facing 
camera. The camera app on the new Note 5 packs some goodies from the 
Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge+, such as the Live Broadcast feature which 
allows users to live stream video directly to a connected YouTube 
account. Samsung India believes that the new Live Broadcast feature will
 find early adopters similar to popular apps like Periscope and Meerkat.
 However, the company declined to comment about whether the feature will
 be landing on older devices.In our limited tests of the cameras,
 we found the images taken with the Galaxy Note 5 in normal indoor 
lighting to be vibrant with proper colours showing up. Low-light shots 
also seemed good.Final ThoughtsThe new Samsung Galaxy Note
 5 definitely brings some upgraded innards and slight updates to the UI 
compared to its predecessor. One of the most notable differences between
 the Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note 5 in India has been the pricing. 
While the Galaxy Note 4 was launched last year 
starting at Rs. 61,500 (with the market price settling at around Rs. 
58,500), the new Galaxy Note 5, on the other hand, starts at Rs. 53,900 
for the 32GB model. The 64GB Galaxy Note 5 variant will be available at 
Rs. 59,900. Both will go on sale starting September 20 in India.For
 new users, the new lower pricing of the Galaxy Note 5 may be great 
news. There doesn't seem to be any reason that Galaxy Note 4 users will 
want to go for the upgraded version, but those using previous models in 
the series might be tempted. At these prices, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus 
(Review | Pictures) remains a tough competitor to the Note 5, and its successor will be even
 more compelling if pricing stays the same.
