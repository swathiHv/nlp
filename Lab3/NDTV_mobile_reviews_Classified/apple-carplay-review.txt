Apple CarPlay Review

Apple is getting ready to hitch the iPhone to cars in a mobile marriage of convenience.The
 ambitious project, called CarPlay, implants some of the iPhone's main 
applications in automobiles so drivers can control them with voice 
commands, a touch on the steering wheel or a swipe on a display screen 
in the dashboard.It's expected to be available this summer when 
Pioneer Electronics plans to release a software update for five car 
radios designed to work with the iPhone. Alpine Electronics also is 
working on CarPlay-compatible radios for cars already on the road. 
Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and Ferrari are among those 
expected to start selling car models with built-in CarPlay services this
 year.Google Inc. is working with car makers to do something 
similar with smartphones running its Android operating system, but Apple
 Inc. appears to be further along in efforts to make it easier and safer
 to text, email, get directions, select music and, yes, even make calls 
while driving.I recently checked out a test version of CarPlay in a van equipped with a Pioneer radio designed to work with the iPhone.The
 demonstration through the streets of San Francisco convinced me that 
Apple is on the right track. The CarPlay system is bound to appeal to 
iPhone fans who spend a lot of time behind the wheel. It makes less 
sense for iPhone owners who, like me, spend more of their time walking 
and riding public transportation instead of driving.If you want 
CarPlay, you will need an iPhone 5, iPhone 5s or iPhone 5c. An iPad won't work. The 
phones also must be running Apple's latest software, iOS 7.1. Free 
upgrades are available for older phones.If you already have one of Pioneer's five compatible radios, a free firmware update is all you'll need.Otherwise,
 CarPlay's biggest drawback is the cost. If you want it in a car you 
already own, compatible radios from Pioneer sell for $700 to $1,400. 
After factoring in other required parts and labor, figure on spending 
$900 to $1,000 just to get Pioneer's least-expensive CarPlay system in 
your vehicle. That's more than the price of a new iPhone, but cheaper 
than buying a new car with CarPlay built in.Pioneer's 
top-of-the-line CarPlay radio features a 7-inch screen that shows the 
iPhone apps for calls, contacts, music, maps and messaging when the 
device is plugged in with a cable.Other mobile music apps, 
including Spotify, Beats Music and iHeartRadio, are supposed to be 
eventually available on CarPlay, too. Facebook, YouTube and other apps 
that show a lot of photos and video won't be available for safety and 
legal reasons.The key to CarPlay's success may hinge on Siri, the
 iPhone's digital personal assistant. Apple has been striving to make 
Siri smarter and more versatile, an endeavor that CarPlay figures to put
 to the test.Siri serves as CarPlay's central nervous system, 
doing everything from taking email dictation, reading incoming text 
messages out load, and scrolling through the system for song requests or
 different genres of music. Summoning Siri can be done by touching a 
button on the steering wheel or CarPlay's display screen.While 
CarPlay also responds to touch, the system is at its best when Siri is 
doing most of the work. I got only a half-hour demo of CarPlay, too 
little time to determine whether Siri will be up to the job.Within
 minutes of getting in the car, Siri couldn't retrieve the correct 
address for a requested restaurant in San Francisco. Instead, CarPlay 
listed several other places with the same name, so Siri apparently at 
least heard the request correctly. The omission of the requested 
restaurant may have reflected shortcomings in Apple's database of local 
businesses.Beyond that, Siri performed flawlessly reading back 
incoming texts, composing and sending emails and playing the role of 
disc jockey when asked to play the music of specific artists such as 
AC/DC. It took only a few seconds before "Back in Black" blasted through
 the stereo. Even a question about Arnold Schwarzenegger, a name that 
can be difficult to decipher, didn't stump Siri.If Siri is able 
to consistently handle those kinds of challenges, then CarPlay could 
make the iPhone an even more indispensable mobile device.
