iPhone 6 Review: The Most Appealing iPhone Ever

Apple finally gave the iPhone a much-needed rethink, 
and the result is a product that is more like its competition than ever 
before, but also stands out just as well, if not better, in a seriously 
overcrowded market. The big talking point is its screen size - months of
 leaks told us nearly everything we needed to know long before the 
actual launch happened - but there's also plenty more to explore. As 
always, Apple has managed to deliver more power, better aesthetics, 
improved cameras, and all-new software.The iPhone 6 shares a lot 
with its larger sibling, the iPhone 6 Plus (Review | Photos), which we reviewed a little 
while ago. They're obviously designed to look similar, but Apple has 
also made sure they're very similar to use. The iPhone 6 is still just 
as much of a premium device as ever; not a lower-end version of a new 
flagship. A lot of what we've said in that exhaustive review of the 6 
Plus will apply to the iPhone 6 as well.Apple's unique position 
lets it control and tightly integrate the hardware and software 
experiences of its products. We see all of this and more in this year's 
new iPhones. Look and feelGone are the flat edges and 
sharp angles of the iPhone 5s. The iPhone 6 feels smooth and slick, with
 a lovely dark glass front that looks like a pool of ink. The glass is 
raised above its rim and is curved at the edges so that it meets the 
metal in a smooth curve. It seems as though the glass could shatter very
 easily if this phone is dropped and lands on a corner, which is just 
one of many reasons to invest in a case of some sort.Another good
 reason is that the rear of the iPhone 6 is one of the least attractive 
designs we've ever seen coming out of Apple. The plastic antenna lines 
intersecting the metal body are just too prominent. There's a bunch of 
regulatory text and logos which we wish could have been less prominent, 
and then of course there's the infamous camera bulge. The little nubbin 
really does stick out prominently, and we couldn't help fidgeting with 
it when holding the iPhone 6 in our hands.The top is blank, 
because the power button has now been moved to the upper right side, 
just above the Nano-SIM card tray. This will be disconcerting for 
long-time iPhone users. The move was probably not necessary, given this 
phone's still-manageable size, but it keeps things consistent with the 
design of the iPhone 6 Plus. The ringer mute switch and volume buttons 
are on the left edge per usual, and the Lightning port and headset 
socket are on the bottom. We cannot overstate the quality of Apple's 
fabrication and machining processes; all the buttons have just the right
 feel, and even the charger's Lightning connector slips into its port 
with a satisfying thunk.This is a very satisfying phone to hold 
and to use. We didn't think Apple needed to make its iPhones any 
slimmer, but we really like the iPhone 6 when we hold it in our hands. 
The weight and balance are also just right, so we're glad Apple finally 
embraced the idea of producing a bigger phone.SpecificationsThe
 iPhone 6 uses Apple's new A8 processor, designed in-house but based on 
the industry-standard ARM architecture. There's a separate co-processor 
called the M8 for sensor input, which helps save battery life by 
allowing the A8 to go to sleep while physical activity is constantly 
detected and processed in the background.The screen is of course 
larger than those on the iPhone 5 generation models but still a lot 
smaller than the one on the iPhone 6 Plus. The resolution isn't a huge 
bump up from that of the iPhone 5 series, and the pixel density is 
exactly the same. We liked the crisp, bright display on the 6 Plus, and 
while the one on the iPhone 6 is just as good in terms of quality, it 
doesn't feel very exciting. Competitors have long surpassed Apple in 
terms of resolution, and the difference between some of the current 
Android flagships and the iPhone 6 is definitely noticeable, if 
ultimately unimportant. There's 1GB of RAM which seems stingy 
compared to Android devices today, though we didn't find this to be much
 of a problem on the iPhone 6 Plus when we reviewed it. The fact that 
storage is not expandable is a constant frustration for us - iPhones are
 already expensive and it just hurts to have to pay a ridiculous amount 
over and above the starting price just to have enough space to actually 
use these devices to their full potential.The relatively new 
high-speed Wi-Fi ac standard is supported, as is Bluetooth 4.0. LTE is 
supported on the Indian 2300MHz band and NFC is new to this iPhone 
generation, but only works with Apple Pay which isn't available outside 
the USA yet.SoftwareA large part of the iPhone 6's appeal 
lies in iOS - more specifically, iOS 8. Not all features work as well on
 older iPhones, so software alone is not a strong enough reason to 
upgrade from a device that's less than three years old. iOS 8 has
 lots of new features, big and small. Little things such as 
much-improved photo editing tools, Notification Centre widgets, tweaks 
in Safari and voice messages over iMessage all contribute to making the 
iPhone 6 a pleasure to use. App extensions are usually subtle, but this 
feature represents one of the best new things about iOS, and developers 
will surely take better advantage of it over time. Custom keyboards will
 be a game-changer for Apple, and some truly innovative apps have sprung
 up letting you do all kinds of things with messages. Improvements to 
mail handling and iTunes content management area also much appreciated. One
 of the most visible new iOS 8 features is the Health app. This is a 
little unintuitive to use - you can see an activity dashboard and 
entries for dozens of trackable metrics, but things only really take off
 when you download additional apps that use the Healthkit framework and 
populate all that information. The combination of Healthkit and the M8 
coprocessor allow for some very detailed and impressive information 
gathering. There's still a lot that could be improved. It's very 
un-Apple to have so many things to track - things such as Molybdenum, 
Peripheral Perfusion Index and Selenium are not within the consciousness
 of the average user, but there are still ways to track all of them so 
it seems pointless to present them all right at the beginning.The
 Reachability shortcut, ie double-tapping the Home button to make the 
screen's contents slide down towards your fingers, is pretty handy but 
you have to develop a habit of using it or you might forget it's there. 
It's going to take a long time for apps to be updated with the correct 
screen resolution and scaling factor, but those that have been optimised
 look great.iPhone owners who also use a Mac and/or an iPad might
 also want to try out the new Continuity features. Some have limited 
appeal, such as being able to make voice calls from a Mac through an 
iPhone, whereas the ability to begin composing an email on one device 
and then just continue from anywhere on another could really improve the
 way people work. CameraThe rear camera is still 8 
megapixels, but the lens and sensor have been improved to allow for 
better low-light shots and colour accuracy. Videos can now be taken with
 continuous autofocus and improved stabilisation. 120fps slow-motion, 
which was introduced with the iPhone 5s now coexists with 240fps 
slow-motion, and there's a new time-lapse mode in iOS 8 that older 
phones can also use.(Click to see full size)Apple's camera app is mostly barebones - 
there are no fancy special effects or multi-page menus of options. The 
new capabilities of the iPhone 6 and iOS 8 are thus easy to discover, 
but it's beginning to feel as though Apple can't decide whether to offer
 more options or keep its interface minimalist.(Click to see full size)4K video recording
 is missing, and the iPhone 6 falls behind its competitors in this 
regard. Even if you don't plan on shooting all your videos at such a 
high resolution, it's nice to have the option to do so. The cap on 
storage space would also make it very difficult to store 4K videos.(Click to see full size)We
 were very happy with the iPhone 6's camera. Images taken during the day
 were crisp with accurate colours and superb levels of detail. Closeups 
were brilliant, and even distant objects were captured very well. 
Low-light performance was also admirable - the iPhone 6 works very well 
indoors as well as outdoors, even with minimal artificial or ambient 
lighting. We were constantly surprised by how well shots came out - 
there was noticeable noise but details were still well defined when seen
 at reduced size on a screen. Photos came out looking as though they had
 been taken in far better light. (Click to see full size)PerformanceOnce again, 
we're reminded that numbers and acronyms on a specifications sheet can't
 always be used to judge a device. The dual-core Apple A8 processor and 
its integrated graphics capabilities are more than capable of holding 
their own against quad- and octa-core products from leading competitors.
 We had no problems with the iPhone 6, whether we were playing 
heavy games, recording high-speed video, multitasking, or just relaxing 
while browsing the Web. The phone is super-responsive, and unique 
features such as Apple's Touch ID sensor just make the whole experience 
of using an iPhone butter-smooth. There are of course things that aren't
 as flexible or functional as they are in Android, but overall, the iOS 
platform is a joy to use.Benchmark scores were very, very good. 
Largely due to the fact that the powerful A8 processor doesn't have to 
push itself to drive a very high-res screen, we managed to achieve some 
superb scores in graphics-intensive benchmarks. GFXBench produced a 
record high of 50.1fps, while 3DMark Ice Storm was maxed out in the 
regular and Extreme modes, but posted a score of 17,302 in the Unlimited
 mode. HD videos also played without a hitch.AnTuTu for iOS gave 
us a phenomenal score of 49,319 points which is practically the same as 
the 49,353 points the iPhone 6 Plus managed. The test still detects a 
resolution of 640x1136 though, which explains the similar scores and 
means they aren't representative of either device at its native 
resolution.Battery life was pretty good, but we were hoping for 
spectacular. Our video loop test ran for 7 hours, 40 minutes. This is a 
clear point in favour of the much larger iPhone 6 Plus. Call quality was
 superb, but we do with Apple could work on better speakers for its 
iPhones - the single mono speaker on the bottom isn't very loud or rich,
 and competitors do much better.VerdictAs we stated in our
 review of the iPhone 6 Plus, Apple's two new devices are very similar 
in terms of the experience they deliver, with only the screen size 
setting them apart. Thus, users can choose the screen size (and physical
 size) that suits them better, without feeling as though they've 
compromised by picking a lesser device either way. In the Android world,
 larger phones tend to hog all the best features, and "mini" versions 
are almost always cut down.That said, the iPhone 6's relatively 
smaller body means that the battery is smaller, and the camera has to 
make do without optical image stabilisation. On the other hand, each 
iPhone 6 model comes in at Rs. 9,000 less expensive than the equivalent 
iPhone 6 Plus. We think most people would be better off with a 64GB 
iPhone 6 than a 16GB iPhone 6 Plus at the same price. Specifications
 shouldn't fool you into thinking this phone is any less powerful than 
an Android flagship. If you've been waiting for a reason to ditch an old
 phone and jump onto the Apple bandwagon, the iPhone 6 is one of the 
best reasons to do so. If you're thinking of upgrading from an iPhone 4S
 or earlier, you'll absolutely love what the iPhone 6 has to offer. 
Naturally, the difference won't be as stark for iPhone 5 or 5s owners 
running iOS 8, and they can easily stick with their current phones for 
another year or so unless they really feel like splurging.If you aren't sure whether you want to choose Android or an iPhone, there are quite a few options to choose from. This generation's flagships, the Sony Xperia Z3 (Review | Photos) Samsung Galaxy S5 (Review | Photos) HTC One (M8) (Review | Photos) and LG G3 (Review | Photos) are all larger but most of them are quite a bit less expensive and also offer value in the form of features such as expandable storage and 4K video recording.One 
final note: when reviewing new flagship phones, we usually consider 
whether their own predecessors offer good value, considering how prices 
tend to fall. Amazingly, the iPhone 5s (16GB) is still officially sold 
for Rs. 53,500 which is the same price as the iPhone 6! If you can find a
 5s in retail for less than Rs. 40,000 today, it's still a great deal. 
An official 5s price cut is long overdue, at which point the 32GB model 
will be cheaper than the 16GB iPhone 6 - this will be a very tempting 
option indeed. iPhone 6 in pictures
