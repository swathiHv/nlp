Sony Xperia Z1 Compact review

Smartphones have gotten ridiculously big, and unfortunately, most 
Android manufacturers today have decided that their top-end phones 
should have five-inch screens at the minimum. It isn't because they can sneak in 
more space for a larger battery and better heat dissipation; it's just a
 sort of herd mentality and the desire to outdo each other that keeps 
things going along a certain trajectory.At least Sony seems to 
think we've reached a point of diminishing returns, and has done what it
 can to balance things out with a more reasonably sized phone that 
doesn't compromise on its internals. The Z1 Compact isn't a flagship on 
its own, but it's far more equal to the device it's been spun off from 
than many of the underpowered "mini" phones that have tried to trade on 
their names.In fact it's almost ridiculous that we automatically 
think of this as a "miniature" phone, or one that's somehow reduced in 
importance by having a small screen. This is what has been, and for many
 should still be, perfectly normal. We're happy to see physical size 
decoupled from power, such that buyers who aspire to class-leading 
smartphones can now actually get one that can be used comfortably with 
one hand and held up to an ear without risking a wrist injury.Look and feelThe
 Z1 Compact is somewhat similar to the iPhone 5 in terms of size and 
proportion, though that's where the similarity ends. The Z1 Compact 
feels chunky in the hand, rather than elegant. The combination of 
bevelled metallic sides and waterproof flaps made even our bright pink 
review unit feel outdoorsy and rugged. Sony hasn't followed the 
crowd by crippling its second-best phone's specifications, but it has 
evidently felt the need to offer it in bright colours, possibly to 
pander to women (who, research apparently suggests, prefer smaller 
phones anyway). In addition to the usual blank and white, the Compact is
 available in pink and yellow.Photos might not show this very 
well, but the plastic and metal parts of the pink variant are actually 
two quite different shades. While the metal band around the edges is a 
pale, muted rose tint, the plastic front and rear are bright, almost 
fluorescent, bubblegum pink. The effect is striking, and very memorable.
 Needless to say, if you aren't very certain you can live with this 
colour, you should stick to the safer white or black.The Z1 
Compact's front panel is all black glass, with only a silver Sony logo 
and a barely visible front camera right on top to break it up. The 
speaker grille is a tiny notch right at the top (into which the charging
 and status LED is cleverly integrated), and the navigation buttons are 
all on-screen rather than capacitive, so there's nothing at all to see 
when the device is in standby.The metallic band around the edges 
houses all the Z1 Compact's buttons and slots. On the right, you'll see 
Sony's new brand identifier, a round silver standby button. Below it are
 a slim volume rocker and a tiny camera shortcut and shutter release 
button. Since this isn't an oversized phone, we would have liked to have
 the standby button in its traditional place on the top panel, but that 
wasn't to be.The left edge is quite packed, with three 
rubber-rimmed flaps for the Micro-USB charging/data port, microSD card 
slot, and SIM card slot. Sony's magnetic Z-series accessory connector is
 right in the middle, but it looks oddly gouged out, especially since 
the flaps on either side of it are perfectly flush with the rim. If it 
weren't for the phone's overall chunky design, the dock connector would 
look awful.The USB port and microSD card slot are perfectly 
ordinary beneath their flaps, but the Micro-SIM slot is a bit fidgety. 
You have to fit your SIM card into a removable tray which can only be 
extracted from the slot with a fingernail. Under the same flap, 
there's also a pull-out tab with regulatory information printed on it, 
which keeps the rear panel free of extra text and logos.You'll 
find an unprotected 3.5mm headset jack on the top edge, and a large 
speaker grille across the entire bottom. In another nod to potential 
female buyers, there's a hole in the bottom right corner for a lanyard 
or phone charm. The rear panel is quite flat, with only the 
camera lens and flash breaking up the vast expanse of (in our case pink)
 plastic. Apart from a Sony logo in the middle and a smaller Xperia logo
 on the bottom, there's a tiny printed icon to let you know that this 
phone features the NFC wireless standard. The only complaint we 
have about the Z1 Compact's build quality is that the front and back are
 a little too flexible, and we could feel the plastic bend with very 
little pressure applied. For an otherwise rugged phone, this made us 
feel just a little uneasy.Features and specificationsAs 
already stated, the Z1 Compact is not a stripped-down phone. It's got 
the kind of components we expect to see in a top-end device, including a 
quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 SoC running at 2.2GHz with integrated 
Adreno 330 graphics, 2GB of RAM, Android 4.3, a 2300mAh battery, and a 
20.7-megapixel rear camera. The screen isn't full-HD 1080p, though at 
4.3 inches diagonally, 720p is acceptable. There's 16GB of built-in 
storage, and a microSD card slot for up to 64GB more.The complete
 list of specifications manages to cover all bases, including high-speed
 Wi-Fi ac, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC, GPS with GLONASS, LTE, FM radio, active 
noise cancellation, and a USB port supporting HDMI video out via an MHL 
adapter. The icing on the cake is an IP58 rating for waterproofing; in 
this case the phone is rated for 30 minutes of exposure up to 1.5m deep.NFC
 enables the Z1 Compact to pair with a range of accessories, including 
Sony's Smart Watch 2, QX100 external camera, and various headsets or 
speakers. You can also establish connections to other NFC-enabled 
Android phones. Sony has equipped some of its TVs and laptops with NFC 
too, so you can back up photos or show them off on a bigger screen.The front panel 
is made with tempered glass, but this isn't the Gorilla Glass we're 
familiar with. Sony
 has also been sharing some of its technology (and trademarked 
buzzwords) between departments of late, so the screen is a "Triluminous 
display" with "X-Reality", which claims to reproduce a much wider colour
 range than ordinary displays can, and improve image clarity.Â  The camera inherits Sony's "Exmor RS sensor", "G Lens", 
and "Bionz" image processing tech.SoftwareThe Android skin
 on Sony's current Xperia devices is rather extensive, and nearly 
everything from the lock screen to the apps, has been customised. You 
can create up to seven home screens and populate them with a variety of 
widgets. Sony has created quite a few of its own, including one 
that seems to advertise music from Sony's label (and warns users that it
 downloads "large amounts of data" the first time it's tapped). One lets
 you launch the TrackID app and begin listening for music. Another 
widget lets you launch the camera or one of the build in "camera apps" 
(which we'll describe below). Beyond that, there are the usual weather, 
music control, social, contacts and control widgets.The company 
has also not shied away from docking its own Sony Liv and Sony Music 
apps to the home screen. Other apps in the menu include Bigflix, Line, 
LinkedIn, Box, Pixlr Express, X4 video player, and McAfee Security. Sony
 also bundles Mobisystems Office Suite, but this is a trial that doesn't
 let you create new documents.Smart Connect is an interesting app
 that lets you send content to compatible Sony devices such as TVs and 
speakers, and also trigger events that can happen on schedule or when 
accessories are connected. For example, you can create a routine that 
sets an alarm and turns all other sounds off if you plug in a charger 
between 10pm and 7am. The conditions are pretty granular, and Sony has 
made it easy to set up triggers and effects.In addition to the 
usual slew of Google apps, there's a simple unit converter app, a 
sketching app, a drag-and-share app for Bluetooth file transfers, a file
 manager, and the aforementioned TrackID app. Interestingly, the default
 Web browser is Chrome, and the stock Android browser is nowhere to be 
seen.Sony's skin is a bit dense, and might intimidate new users. 
We like the sidebar in the main menu that lets users rearrange apps, 
although the search bar could have been a little more obvious to find. 
The notifications panel has a convenient (and customisable) panel of 
shortcut toggles for important settings, but even this looks a little 
crowded.CameraSony makes a lot of claims about the 
performance of the Z1 Compact's camera, including excellent low-light 
performance, high sensitivity, low noise, vibrant realism, and pretty 
much every marketing superlative you can come up with. We found many of 
these claims to be accurate, but even so, there are limits to what a 
smartphone camera can achieve.First of all, Sony has worked on a 
pretty clever camera app. The interface isn't cluttered, and all the 
important functions are a single tap away. The app can detect when 
you're moving and when light is too low, and adjust itself accordingly. 
There are also modes for macro shots and documents, which are pretty 
handy. There's a large icon, like a camera's mode dial, which lets you 
jump into any of the camera apps. These include a manual mode, timeshift
 burst, sweep panorama, effect filters, and AR effect. By default, 
you're in Superior Auto mode, which is simple and direct. Manual mode 
gives you control over settings such as white balance, and access to 
scenes including landscape, night, HDR, sports, snow and party.Timeshift
 effect saves a burst of photos including a few buffered before you 
actually hit the shutter. Picture effect offers nine options including 
fisheye, sepia, kaleidoscope, selective colour, and Harris shutter. AR 
effect tries to add things like dinosaurs or party hats to images, all 
of which look rather silly but can be fun.There are also two 
other camera apps: Info-eye and Social Live. The former lets you take 
photos of objects and receive information based on an image recognition 
search. This could include tourist monuments, products, or just 
interesting sights. Social Live lets you broadcast live video on 
Facebook, turning your phone into something like a remote webcam.(Click to see full size)While
 these are all interesting, we got right down to testing image quality 
without all the special effects. We found that the 20.7-megapixel photos
 were rather good, with rich colours and effective contrast. The camera 
was also exceptionally good at capturing images while in motion. Things 
went a little downhill when we zoomed in all the way. Finer details in 
shady areas of an image were noticeably unclear, and a bit of noise 
crept in. Performance in various lighting conditions was consistent, 
though we found the flash to be a little too aggressive sometimes; 
drowning out nearby subjects.This is still a lot better than many
 smartphone cameras can manage, but should illustrate that no matter how
 many buzzwords a company throws out, expectations need to be realistic.PerformanceHere's
 where the Z1 Compact gets to really show us what it's made of. We were 
very pleased with the benchmark results, which are right up there with 
the major flagships from most companies. SunSpider took only 916.6ms to 
complete, and Mozilla Kraken took 7580.2ms, which is significantly 
quicker than other mid-range "mini" phones. Quadrant returned a score of
 21,100 points, and AnTuTu raced ahead with 35,649 points.We were
 also happy and relieved to see graphics performance right up there with
 the best scores we have on record. GFXBench managed an impressive 34.9fps, and 
3DMark maxed out, even in the more intensive Ice Storm Extreme scenario 
designed for 1080p phones. We ran the Ice Storm Unlimited test instead, 
which is usually reserved for more demanding tablets, and scored 17,976 
points.Audio and video played back flawlessly, including our 
heaviest 40mbps H.264 clip. Sound was loud across various games, movies and music files, but not very clear at high volume. Call quality was perfectly
 ordinary, with nothing special to mention. The battery lasted for an impressive 11 hours, 52 minutes in our video loop test. All of this makes for a very strong showing, and we're mighty impressed. The Xperia Z1 Compact is no lightweight. If there was any doubt left in your mind about this phone's capabilities, we hope they're well and truly laid to rest now.VerdictIt's 
very easy to recommend the Z1 Compact. You might not like the styling or
 the overabundance of ports and flaps, but that's the tradeoff for waterproofing, which is definitely a 
neat feature. As for alternatives in this price range, you could buy an LG G2, which is 
larger, or an iPhone 5c which is roughly the same size but not as powerful. The Sony 
Xperia Z1 Compact is exactly the kind of product we've wanted to see for
 a long time. The smartphone industry is too eager to follow trends, and
 a recent features arms race has led to a staggering tilt in favour of 
phones with 5-inch-plus screens. We're not happy recommending less 
powerful phones to those who don't want to deal with bulky, heavy 
devices, and now we finally have a worthy product in that space. Sony is
 really on to something here, and we hope the rest of the industry takes
 note and follows suit. Sony Xperia Z1 Compact in pictures
