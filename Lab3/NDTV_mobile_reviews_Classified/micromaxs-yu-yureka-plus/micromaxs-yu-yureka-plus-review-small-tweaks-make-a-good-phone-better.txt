Micromax's Yu Yureka Plus Review: Small Tweaks Make a Good Phone Better

At
 the beginning of 2015, Micromax launched the new Yu brand and series of smartphones. These devices are only available online but offer great specifications at low prices, focusing on the 
increased customisation options offered by the CyanogenMod operating system that 
Yu preloads onto its devices. The Yureka (Review | Pictures) and Yuphoria (Review | Pictures) both offer the 
benefits of customisability and great specifications at competitive 
prices, and have enjoyed some success. Yu's third product is the Yureka 
Plus. At Rs. 9,999, it's Rs. 1,000 more expensive than the Yureka, and adds a bit to the spec sheet 
to justify the price hike. The two big changes are a higher-resolution 
full-HD screen and a new camera sensor that should improve photo quality by a bit. We go into the details to find out what the Yureka 
Plus is all about.Look and FeelThe Yureka Plus has inherited its predecessor's nomenclature for a reason; it looks and feels exactly like the Yu 
Yureka. There is not a single thing different, and you wouldn't be able 
to tell the difference between the Yureka and Yureka Plus if both were to be placed 
side-by-side. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, since we quite liked 
the way the Yureka was designed. From the minimalist look in front to the textured 'moonstone grey' back
 panel, the phone is still attractive and feels great to 
hold.Most of the rest of the device design remains the same as 
well. The primary SIM and microSD slots are only accessible by removing 
the battery, while the second SIM slot is hot-swappable and doesn't need
 the phone to be switched off. Power and volume controls remain in the same 
places as before, while the only marking on the front is a circle that
 denotes the home button. The three soft keys light up when the screen 
is on, and the phone lets you set any or all of the keys to wake the 
device with a double tap. The only difference you'll perceive is a 
visibly sharper and more detailed full-HD screen. We were happy with the
 Yureka's 720p screen at the time of reviewing it, but the market has changed a
 lot since then. With the spec war heating up, a 1080p screen in the 
sub-Rs. 10,000 segment isn't impossible anymore. Yu has been smart, 
as the full-HD screen adds tremendous value 
to the package. It is sharp, detailed, and accurate with 
colours. Although it's sufficiently bright indoors, outdoor visibility 
suffers a bit since it can't get quite as bright as it needs to. 
However, it's still a far better screen than we're used to seeing at 
this price level.Specifications and SoftwareWhen the Yu 
Yureka first broke onto the scene, its specifications list was impressive
 to say the least. At a time when the vast majority of budget phones 
were using lower-cost MediaTekÂ 
SoCs, the Yureka used the then-new Snapdragon 615.  Apart from that 
there was also 16GB of internal storage and 2GB of RAM, along with 4G 
compatibility and Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. These 
specifications remain the same on the Yureka Plus, and unfortunately 
don't quite have the same shock value anymore since a long list of devices in 
this price bracket have matched them. However, it's 
still a competitive set of components for the price and will remain competitive for a long time to come.Yu has stuck to Cyanogen 12 OS for the 
Yureka Plus, although the system is based on Android 
5.0.2 out of the box, an upgrade over the Yureka which came with Android
 4.4.4. We're big fans of the operating system, since it offers a host 
of customisability options that let you set your phone up exactly how 
you want it. From button functions to the lockscreen; from the status 
and pull-down bar to the notification drawer; everything is customisable
 and can be adjusted to your liking. Above all, it's a quick and 
efficient system that is a pleasure to use. Very little is different from
 what the Yureka offers.There's also very little bloatware on the 
system, and the handful of apps that are present are actually incredibly
 useful. AudioFX is a system-wide audio equaliser and 
controller, while Screencast lets you record video of your phone's 
screen. Perhaps the only app we didn't care much for was the Yuniverse 
Opera-based browser. Fortunately it could be uninstalled and was out of 
our way within seconds.CameraThe second thing that has changed in going from Yureka to Yureka Plus is the camera module. 
While the Yureka used the older Sony IMX135 sensor, the Yureka Plus has 
the newer IMX214 sensor. Although both are 13-megapixel sensors, the 
IMX214 has small technical tweaks that promise better photography and 
videography, including improved support for HDR stills and video.In
 practice, the camera is at least as impressive as the one on the Yureka. 
Pictures are detailed, sharp and have colours that are vibrant and truly
 pop. You have to zoom really far in on a desktop monitor to reveal any 
flaws in the images, and whites have the proper colour tone. However, 
there are definite issues in the handling of low-light situations, with dark zones 
in images appearing too dark to be able to spot any detail.(Click for full-size image)HDR 
mode offered excellent results, with the already great colour 
handling improving dramatically. We generally preferred to shoot in HDR 
mode, as the effect was subtle, yet visible. Video was usually good, as 
were close up shots. With the exception of the slight problems with 
low-light shooting, the camera on the Yureka Plus is slightly improved 
over the one on the Yureka. The front camera takes acceptable shots, 
although it also suffers from the same tendency to underperform with 
low-light shots.The camera app is minimalistic and 
easy to use, with settings icons occupying only a small part of the screen, 
keeping most of it for the viewfinder. There are buttons for quick 
video, photo and panorama shots, along with a flash selector, the camera switcher 
and a shortcut to the various modes. It's well designed and makes camera use easy. We 
had some issues with the speed of the autofocus on the Yureka which have
 been fixed with the Yureka Plus; autofocus is usually quick and 
effortless.(Click for full-size image)PerformanceThe Yu Yureka Plus is a capable 
device in terms of performance, thanks to the combination of a good SoC, strong specifications, and an excellent operating system. Our collection of
 test videos loaded and ran well, including the most heavily encoded clips. 
Even with apps and games, the phone ran fairly well most of the time, with 
graphics slowing down only slightly on rare occasions. High intensity games such as Angry Birds 2 and Asphalt 8 ran smoothly on the device, but there was a definite heating issue near the top of the device. This also caused a heavy battery drain with even just 15 minutes of gaming.Benchmark 
tests showed excellent numbers for a phone using the Snapdragon 615 SoC,
 and all scores were slightly higher than those recorded on the Yu 
Yureka. AnTuTu and Quadrant returned commendable scores of 34,457 and 
24,116 respectively, while GFXBench and 3DMark recorded scores of 14fps
 and 5,477 each. All of this confirms that the Yureka Plus is a good 
performer, and offers excellent returns for the price.Call and 
speaker quality are both decent, and network reception gave us no reason
 to complain. Battery life on the Yureka was underwhelming, but this seems to have been
 improved considerably on the Yureka Plus, despite the higher-resolution
 screen. Our video loop test drained the battery in 10 hours, 5
 minutes, which is a huge improvement over the Yureka. In day to day 
use, the battery drains as quickly as any Android smartphone, and so it should
 comfortably last a full day with normal use.VerdictYu 
has made it a point to keep the fact that it's owned by Micromax as
low-key as possible. This has helped the brand establish itself as an 
independent entity with its own appeal, which has worked 
well. The Yu Yuphoria's popularity is proof of that, and can 
also be seen as a sign of things to come.The Yu
 Yureka was a groundbreaking product when it launched. It showed just 
what a budget smartphone was capable of, and set the stage for what have
 proven to be fun times in the smartphone price wars. It also showed the
 world just how important a good operating system is to the smartphone 
experience.The Yu Yureka Plus is an
 intelligent way to strengthen the company's first product now that the competition has had some time to catch up. It has improved just enough to give it a sense of freshness, while retaining all the qualities that made it stand out in the first place. This 
is what keeps the phone and the company relevant, and we have no issues with 
recommending the Yu Yureka Plus if you're shopping for a smartphone 
under Rs. 10,000.
