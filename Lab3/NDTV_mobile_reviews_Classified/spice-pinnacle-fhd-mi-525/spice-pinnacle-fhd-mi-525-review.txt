Spice Pinnacle FHD Mi-525 review

Many Indian handset manufacturers have come out with interesting 
feature-packed handsets to challenge the dominance of global brands. One
 company that seems to be raising the bar is Spice Mobiles. Its latest 
phablet, the Spice Pinnacle FHD Mi-525 offers a crisp 5.0-inch full-HD 
display and comes packed with a quad-core processor.But is that enough 
to compete in a market that is presently dominated by brands like 
Micromax, Karbonn and Samsung? We try to find out in our review.Design/ Build	Our
 immediate reaction after we took the Spice Pinnacle FHD Mi-525 out of 
the box was that it looked familiar. Spice has opted for a minimalistic 
design for the Pinnacle FHD, which has nothing unusual.The design of the
 Spice Pinnacle FHD is simple, with no hardware keys on the front panel. The
 front of the phone is dominated by the 5-inch full-HD display with three
 capacitive keys lined up below the screen for Settings, Home and Back. 
However, the backlight doesn't illuminate even when the display is on 
till one touches them, which we found a bit odd.The back panel 
houses the camera along with the dual-LED flash and speaker grille 
located at the bottom left.There's some Spice branding on the back of 
the phone.The phablet comes with dimensions of 149.4x74.9x9.3mm 
and weighs around 175 grams, which makes it a bit bulky. The phone comes 
only in a White colour variant.There is a Micro-USB port at the 
bottom while the 3.5mm audio headphone port is located at the top of the
 device.The power key is located on the right side and the volume rocker
 key sits on the left side of the Spice Pinnacle FHD. As with most 
phablets, there is no dedicated camera. The phone has a removable
 back cover and opening it reveals the battery compartment with two SIM 
card slots and a microSD card slot. The SIM cards and the microSD card 
are not hot-swappable because they are placed adjacent to the battery.Overall,
 we found the Spice Pinnacle FHD to be a reasonably good looking device, 
although we wish it had been a bit lighter and sported a textured back. 
The glossy back panel of the Pinnacle FHD tends to slip out of hand.DisplayThe
 Spice Pinnacle FHD comes with a 5-inch full-HD display that has a 
resolution of 1080x1920 pixels and a pixel density of 480ppi, which is 
pretty good, and graphics and text appear sharp. The viewing angles were
 also good and under the sun visibility on the phone's screen was 
decent. The screen is not very reflective. Videos and pictures looked 
good as well.The screen renders text, images and icons sharply 
and the size makes it optimum for watching videos. We played some of our
 favourite videos on the Spice Pinnacle FHD and it didn't disappoint us,
 thanks to the full-HD screen.We also found the touch response of the 
screen to be good.CameraThe 8-megapixel auto-focus camera 
takes good quality images in daylight. However, we noticed that pictures
 taken in low-light conditions did not come out well. Indoor images 
clicked with Pinnacle FHD with less light showed noise on the edges and 
were grainy.The colour reproduction was also not that great.The 
dual-LED flash fulfills its intended purpose. The phone can record 
full-HD videos but we found that the quality of videos captured through 
the rear camera wasn't great. The 2-megapixel front-facing camera comes 
in handy for self-portrait shots while the quality is nothing to rave 
about.The camera is a bit of a disappointment, churning out 
mediocre results, even though it comes equipped with a number of 
shooting modes including Auto, HDR, Panorama, Portrait, Smile Shot, 
Landscape and face-detection. The camera also allows you to adjust 
sharpness, saturation, hue, ISO, and brightness settings.Software/ InterfaceSpice
 Pinnacle FHD Mi-525 runs Android 4.2.1Jelly Bean. Spice has skinned 
some UI elements of the operating system on the Pinnacle FHD and also 
offers a second theme that gives a different icon set. Even the default 
theme that offers stock icons features some minor tweaks with Spice 
choosing a square icon look instead of the plain one that comes 
with stock Android.Android 4.2 brings lock screen widgets that let
 you launch apps like Clock, Camera, Gmail, Google Now, Messaging and 
additional third-party apps straight from the lock screen.The 
notification tray includes toggles for settings such as Wi-Fi, screen 
brightness, auto-rotation, Bluetooth, GPS, data, screen timeouts and 
profiles (for alerts, other notifications and settings). The Phone, 
Contacts, Messaging and Web browser icons are placed on the home screen,
 which can be customized using widgets and shortcuts.There are 
five customizable home screens on which you can park widgets and 
shortcuts and there are Google's basic apps in addition like Maps, Mail,
 Chrome, Current and YouTube. Users can always access the Google Play 
Store to download their favourite apps.The Spice Pinnacle FHD also 
offers five colour accent themes that can change the look of the menu 
lists and some other elements. There is a Gesture screen lock feature in
 the device that allows users to create and enable their own lock screen
 gestures.The device also features Google Now, an Android 4.1 and
 above feature that is a voice-based information assistant and an 
extension of Google search. It uses cards ,which are essentially small 
boxes that offer different sets of information like weather forecast, 
directions, traffic information, scores, appointments and currency 
conversion etc.There is a plethora of pre-installed apps 
including Facebook, M Tracker, News and Weather, TOI, Twitter, YouTube 
and WhatsApp. Spice Cloud also comes preloaded on the device with a free
 usage period for a few initial months.Spice Cloud, a server cloud based
 mobile synchronization service, allows owners of Spice devices to 
automatically and wirelessly store and secure the data present in their 
phone and access the same data on multiple devices. It also offers 
anti-theft features such as remote wipe, remote locking and SIM change 
alerts, and helps in locating the device, if lost. In addition to these 
features, it also allows users to retrieve their call logs.Performance/ Battery LifeThe
 Spice Pinnacle FHD is powered by a 1.5GHz Mediatek MT6589 quad-core 
processor.It has 1GB RAM on-board and PowerVR SGX 544MP GPU. There is 
8GB of internal storage, which is expandable up to 32GB with the help of
 a microSD card.The Android Jelly Bean OS works well, and the 
overall experience of navigating through the interface was impressive. 
We did not experience any lag while launching apps, playing games, 
scrolling web pages or switching between apps. However, one major issue 
that we faced while using the device was the backlight of the three 
capacitive keys going-off after a point of time.The Pinnacle FHD 
has no issues running hardware intensive games and also handled full-HD 
videos smoothly. The phone natively supports popular formats like .AVI 
and .MOV. The device also features a Pop-up Play option that is 
quite helpful while multi-tasking.The speaker on the phone 
delivers decent quality sound at high volume levels, but there's some 
stifle when the phone lies on its back, as the speaker grill is located 
on the back. The headphones that come with the phone offer below average 
sound output. The phone also comes with SRS sound effects that enhanced 
our music experience on the device.The phone also supports FM Radio and 
the reception was good. It also offers Audio Profiles to quickly switch 
between different sound settings.Call quality was good, during 
our testing process. The Pinnacle FHD also includes automatic call 
recording option, so users don't need any third-party apps.It is a 
dual-SIM smartphone with 3G support on both SIM cards, a feature that we
 miss on other devices in this segment.The Spice Pinnacle FHD 
includes a 2100mAh battery and it lasted for a day with medium to heavy 
usage, which includes making calls that lasted for around an hour, an 
email account synced with push notifications, listening to some music 
and playing a few videos, web browsing and regular chit-chats using 
messages.The usage time also includes a bit of gaming, playing 
a relatively high-paced game like Dead Trigger. It's worth noting that we 
had turned off the Wi-Fi while using the device, brightness was at 
maximum level and we were hooked onto 3G. However, altering these can 
help in increasing the battery backup of the phone.VerdictThe
 Spice Pinnacle FHD is a solid offering that delivers a full-HD display 
and decent performance at a very competitive price. It is not without 
its quirks, and a better camera would have definitely helped its case.At
 its current price, it actually faces competition from the likes of the 
Nokia Lumia 720 that is available at a price of around Rs.18,000. The 
Lumia 720 offers Windows Phone 8 OS, Nokia's famed build quality and the
 camera of the device is one of the best in its class.Micromax's 
much-hyped Canvas 4 is also available in the same price segment and at a
 price of Rs. 17,999 but it doesn't offer a full-HD display.Price: Rs. 16,990Spice Pinnacle FHD: In pictures
