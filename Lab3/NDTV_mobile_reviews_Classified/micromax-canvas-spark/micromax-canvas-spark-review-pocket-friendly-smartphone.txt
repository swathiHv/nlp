Micromax Canvas Spark Review: Pocket-Friendly Smartphone

Ever
 since Motorola launched the ultra-budget Moto E (Review | Pictures) last year and enticed first-time smartphone buyers, other big brands such as Asus, Lenovo, and 
Xiaomi have followed suit. While Micromax has had options in
 that price range for years now, the price-to-performance ratio of those
 smartphones was skewed. The only exception was the Micromax Canvas A1 -
 one of the three Android One smartphones made to Google's own standards. Recently, Micromax launched the Canvas Spark, a 
phone that costs a little under Rs. 5,000 and runs Android Lollipop 
out-of-the-box. The Micromax Canvas Spark also has a quad-core processor.
 Should this be the smartphone any first-time buyer should 
consider? Let's find out.Look and feelMicromax has pulled out 
all the stops to create a premium-looking budget device; the 
Canvas Spark. We received a white/gold unit for review but it is 
also available in a grey/silver option. The matte rear curves gently, and
 coupled with the phone's 8.5mm thickness, makes this phone feel really good to hold. 
Moreover, the weight of 134g is distributed evenly across the entire 
body. The gold trim running around the edges is actually plastic but Micromax has given it a metallic coating to 
add some sheen. We saw a similar colour scheme in the Micromax 
Canvas Gold A300.A 4.7-inch screen is front and centre. Above it, one can find the earpiece, front camera, and 
ambient light sensor. Micromax has gone with a row of touch-sensitive 
capacitive buttons for navigation, placed right below the screen. 
These Lollipop-style buttons have thin outlines and are not backlit, which makes it very 
difficult to see them properly.The 
volume rocker and power button are on the right edge. The tactile feedback of these buttons is average at best. Machine-drilled holes for the speaker grille are on the 
bottom of the rear. The camera module on the rear juts slightly out of the 
main body, thereby potentially exposing it to scratches and also causing 
the phone to wobble slightly when placed on a flat surface. A thick metallic Micromax logo is placed below the camera. The rear cover is 
removable but it only reveals the SIM card slots and the microSD card 
slot; the battery is not accessible. Specifications and softwareMicromax
has used the tried-and-tested MediaTek MT6582 SoC on the Canvas Spark. This
 SoC uses four 1.3GHz processor cores and integrated Mali 400 
graphics. The phone also has 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage
 space. Storage can be expanded by up to 32GB using
 a microSD card. The primary camera on the Canvas Spark can 
capture 8-megapixel still images and shoot 720p video, and there is a 2-megapixel camera on the front. The phone accepts two Micro-SIM 
cards, of which at least one can connect to a 3G network. Rounding off 
the other connectivity options are Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and Bluetooth v4.0. A 2000mAh battery powers the device, giving it a 
rated talk time of 7 hours and rated standby time of 335 hours. The 
4.7-inch IPS screen has a resolution of 540x960, which is similar to 
that of the Motorola Moto E (Gen 2). However, the screen of the Moto E (Gen
 2) is slightly smaller at 4.5 inches and therefore looks a little sharper. The Canvas Spark's screen is average at best with decent viewing
 angles but below-average sunlight legibility. Thankfully, the display isn't over saturated and the warm colours look pleasant. The screen is protected by Corning's Gorilla Glass 3, which is good. Micromax hasn't played around much with the stock version of Android Lollipop except 
for changing the background of the app drawer from white to a slightly 
transparent dark grey, and the default icons to pastel-coloured
 flat set. This is actually a great move because the stock Android Lollipop experience is very polished. Micromax has also thrown in a whole ton of third-party apps, 
most of which won't be useful for most people and cannot be uninstalled.Performance and cameraWe
 won't mince any words - we faced a lot of performance issues with the 
Canvas Spark. There were times when an app wouldn't open for a good 15 
seconds after we had touched its icon. Also, sometimes the screen 
wouldn't be responsive after waking the device from standby. Thankfully, these issues
 didn't completely break the experience but the phone definitely did not feel smooth enough. High-end games struggled with constant stutters, but casual games worked fine. We must 
highlight the fact that all the Android One phones use the same SoC, but 
provide a better experience.In the AnTuTu and Quadrant 
benchmark tests the phone scored 19,499 and 5,494 points respectively, which are in line with
 what we achieved with other phones with similar hardware. The Canvas Spark also 
scored 9.3fps and 3,231 in the GFXbench and 3DMark Ice Storm graphics tests. We
 ran our regular set of sample videos and the Canvas Spark only barely managed
 to play the 1080p files; we faced 
constant frame drops. The speaker is adequately loud but sound 
breaks at high volumes. The bundled headset offers decent sound quality but
things improved drastically when we used a pair of reference earphones. The
 sound in phone calls was good and we didn't face any call drops. The 2000mAh battery inside the Canvas Spark lasted 7 hours and 16 
minutes in our video loop test, which is almost on par with other
 phones in the same price range. We must add that in daily use
 we saw the battery life drop drastically whenever we performed any 
processor-intensive task. The 8-megapixel camera is clearly no patch on the Infocus M2's (Review | Pictures), which sells for almost the same price
 as the Canvas Spark. Our sample images did not have properly defined shadows. A lot of areas, especially those which weren't in 
focus, were clearly underexposed and colours were slightly 
oversaturated. The camera app stuttered badly when capturing 720p 
video (the highest resolution possible on this phone) but the 
captured footage was fine, apart from some camera 
shake and the same underexposure issues. Low-light shots were 
mostly grainy. The front camera also struggled with letting in adequate light. VerdictWe really like what Micromax has tried to achieve with the Canvas Spark, but 
unfortunately all that effort didn't really amount to tangible 
performance. The design and the price are the main saving graces for
 this phone. At Rs. 4,999 the Canvas Spark undercuts a lot of the 
competition by at least a thousand rupees, which makes it relatively decent value for money
 for those shopping with a strict budget cap. However, we'd still
 suggest spending a little more and buying the Motorola Moto E (Gen 2) [Review | Pictures] or theXiaomi Redmi 2 (Review | Pictures) instead because for a little bit extra, you can get a much, much better smartphone experience.
