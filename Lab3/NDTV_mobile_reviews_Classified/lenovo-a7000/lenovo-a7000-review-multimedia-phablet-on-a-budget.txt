Lenovo A7000 Review: Multimedia Phablet on a Budget

As
 phones started becoming smart, people discovered they could do much more than just make calls. Today, there are many who use a phone to surf the Web, chat with people
using messenger apps, listen to music, watch movies, and play games. These capabilities don't require high-end hardware anymore. Lenovo understands there
 is a huge market for affordable multimedia smartphones, and has engineered the 
Lenovo A7000 for precisely this reason.With a big screen, meaty 
battery and powerful processor, the A7000 ticks all the 
right boxes for a smartphone. This 5.5-inch phablet is 
pretty affordable and has another interesting trick - it's the world's first phone to 
feature Dolby Atmos. Let's see if the A7000 is 
worth its salt and can overcome the intense competition in this price range.  Look and feelIf we have to put it
 bluntly, the Lenovo A7000 looks like someone stretched the Lenovo A6000 (Review | Pictures) 
from its corners and flattened it, which is to say it looks strikingly 
similar to its smaller sibling. In our review of the A6000, we said we really didn't mind its utilitarian design, and we stand by that for the A7000 as well. The phone has an unassuming
 design with rounded edges and a matte-finished rear. It is only 8mm thick
 and weighs 140g. The A7000 is quite possibly one of the most ergonomic budget
smartphones with a 5.5-inch screen.The entire
 phone is made of plastic but it doesn't feel cheap. We found it  to be adequately sturdy and it should be able to withstand some amount of rough usage. The right
 edge of the phone houses the volume rocker and the power button. These 
are made of metal and have great tactile feedback. There is
 a microphone at the bottom. The top edge, on the other hand, has 
the 3.5mm audio port and the Micro-USB port. There is a row
 of capacitive buttons below the screen, which aren't backlit, so finding them in the dark will be a hassle. The 
earpiece, front-facing camera, and ambient light sensor are all above the screen. The primary camera and its dual-LED flash
 sit in the top left corner of the rear. The speaker grille is towards the right of the rear and is out of the reach of your fingers when holding the phone, thus not blocking any sound. However, sound is somewhat blocked when the phone is placed flat on
 its rear. The rear cover is removable and underneath it lie the 
battery, two Micro-SIM card slots and a microSD card slot. Specifications and softwareUnder the hood,
 the A7000 uses an octa-core  MediaTek MT6752m SoC clocked at 1.5GHz; an entry-level version of the MT6752. This SoC has integrated 
Mali-T760MP2 graphics. Lenovo has gone with a generous 2GB of RAM but a 
not-so-generous 8GB of internal storage. The storage space can be 
expanded by up to 32GB using a microSD card, and there is 
also support for USB OTG. The USB OTG feature can also be used to charge 
other devices, which might come in handy in emergencies. The
 A7000 has an 8-megapixel camera with a dual-LED flash, and there is also a 
5-megapixel front-facing camera. One of the SIM cards can 
be used to connect to 4G networks even on the 2300MHz frequency band used in India. The other 
connectivity options are Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0. The 
battery has a rated capacity of 2,900mAh.The 5.5-inch IPS LCD 
screen has a resolution of 720p, which translates to a pixel density of 
267ppi. The screen is protected by Asahi's Dragontrail glass. The 
saturation levels of the display are a not too high and it looks 
decently crisp as well. The brightness and viewing angles are not too 
bad either. The phone runs Android 5.0 Lollipop with Lenovo's Vibe UI 3.0 skin on top of it. This skin does not use an app drawer.
 It provides users with a good number of customisation options and there
 is a separate theme app which makes the whole process easier. The 
notification slider and multitasking cards are lifted from Lollipop 
with one tiny exception: Lenovo has added its own quick settings to the 
ones that are present by default. Other than Lenovo's own Shareit and 
Syncit apps, most of the other preinstalled apps can be uninstalled, which you 
might actually want to do because there are a number of them. Performance and cameraThe
 A7000 is pretty powerful and we really didn't see it choke or stutter 
at any point during our time with it. Opening multiple apps 
wasn't a problem either. Even the graphically taxing Asphalt 8 ran 
without dropping frames.In the AnTuTu and Quadrant benchmark 
tests we achieved scores of 30,159 and 14,714 respectively. The graphics 
benchmarks, 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme and GFXbench, returned scores of 22fps and 5,990 points respectively, which show that the A7000 could be a great 
phone for gaming. While the phone did play all our sample videos 
without stuttering, we noticed some strange artefacting in our heavily encoded 40Mbps sample. Videos in other formats and at other resolutions played just fine. We 
were really eager to test Dolby Atmos functionality on the A7000, but unfortunately it
 was a bit of a letdown. Dolby Atmos on the phone is basically an app 
that can be used to tweak its sound handling according to the content that is 
being played - such as music or movies. Frankly, it looks like a 
sophisticated equaliser app that just lets you play around with the sound 
frequency levels to create a sense of space. We tried a ton of content 
ranging from music to movies to games, and the difference between 
regular stereo and Dolby Atmos was nothing to write home about. In fact,
 the phone failed to play Dolby's own lossless demo. Even
 at its maximum volume level the sound is not very loud through either the speakers or the headset. It is not all bad though - the quality of sound 
is really good, which should come as a relief for people who are willing
 to live with the low decibel levels. The phone handles calls without any issues - we didn't face any call drops whatsoever and 
the quality of sound was pretty good too. We were really impressed with 
the battery life on the A6000, which lasted 10 hours and 12 minutes in our video loop test. 
With the A7000, Lenovo actually betters that: the 2900mAh battery lasted 10 hours and 58 minutes this time. If used moderately, users should easily be 
able to get one and a half days' worth of usage with the A7000, which 
is really good. (Click for full size)The camera app in the A7000 is minimalistic and 
we really had fun using it. The 8-megapixel camera is a really fast 
shooter for a budget phone but it takes average photos at best. Our 
daylight samples were underexposed and some of the details looked 
smudged. However, colours were natural and there was no pixellation 
at full resolution. Low-light shots were almost unusable because the 
software obfuscates a lot of detail. The 
front camera can capture some really good selfies, though. Even with continuous autofocus, the camera struggled with holding focus while
 capturing videos. VerdictAt Rs. 8,999 for the A7000, 
Lenovo has once again played the pricing card right. It is at least Rs. 
1,000 cheaper than competing phones such as Micromax's Yu Yureka (Review | Pictures), the Xiaomi Redmi 
Note 4G (Review | Pictures), the Huawei Honor 4X (Review | Pictures) and the Infocus M330 (Review), which definitely gives it an advantage.
 The Lenovo A7000 is a great phone for gaming and for general usage. 
Unfortunately, the multimedia features that were played up during the launch didn't live 
up to our expectations. This doesn't mean that 
the Lenovo A7000 cannot do multimedia at all, it just doesn't do anything extraordinary as 
advertised. All in all, the A7000 is a great phone and its price
 is its biggest advantage.
