LG G Flex2 First Impressions: The Experiment Stabilises a Little

The first LG G Flex was a fascinating phone; not just because of its 
curved screen, but also because it could take a lot of abuse. The rear 
was designed to resist scratches and could actually heal itself from 
mild surface abrasions. The body, including screen and battery, could be
 flexed enough to nearly flatten it out. However, it was shockingly 
expensive and had a low-resolution screen that didn't do it any favours.
 Some people might have paid the full price of Rs. 68,000 at launch 
time, but obviously not enough, and it is now languishing even after a 
50 percent price drop.LG's second-generation G Flex phone - the LG G 
Flex2 - loses some of its signature flexibility but gains a lot of 
appeal. This isn't some outlandish, impractical device anymore, proof 
that LG really has thought about how and where a phone with a curved 
screen might fit into people's lives.LG's booth at MWC in 
Barcelona was buzzing with activity, particularly around this device. 
Crowds of people were jostling to hold and feel the G Flex2. Access was 
difficult, but we did manage to spend some time with a demo unit. Here 
are our first impressions.The LG G Flex2 is visually striking. We
 saw two different colours on display: a dark grey and a very rich red. 
Both were extremely glossy and had dramatic sunburst finishes. The red 
is very eye-catching, which is definitely not going to be to everyone's 
taste.The next thing we noticed about the G Flex2 was that it 
felt a lot slicker than its predecessor. The original LG G Flex (Review | Pictures) was bulky 
and had it not been for its shape, would have been rather unappealing. 
This year's model stands on its own as a very slick, attractive device -
 something you'll want to turn over in your hand and examine from every 
angle.The LG G Flex2 is not meant to be bent, although it is just
 about flexible enough to resist damage if accidentally sat on. In this 
sense, LG seems to have focused on the parts of its idea that actually 
worked, which is a good move all around.The front and sides are 
quite clean, thanks of course to the company's campaign to move buttons 
to the rear. Clearly, this trend isn't disappearing anytime soon. While 
it might have worked on some of LG's past devices, we found that the 
shape of this phone and the particular shallowness of the buttons made 
us press them by accident all the time. We had to fiddle around to find a
 comfortable grip and avoid the buttons, though this could be less of a 
problem as one spends more time with the device.Another thing 
worth noticing on the rear is the sensor for LG's laser autofocus system
 which we saw on the very impressive LG G3 (Review | Pictures). The camera has a dual-LED 
flash and optical image stabilisation. It can take 13-megapixel stills 
and 4K video.Unlike its predecessor, the G Flex2 has a removable 
rear cover. Thanks to the curve, the 3000mAh battery is not a single 
block and so it is not removable. Only the SIM and microSD card slots 
can be accessed. The cover also has an improved anti-scratch coating 
with more effective self-healing capabilities. LG demonstrated this with
 a rather aggressive demo involving metal-tipped brushes on a mechanical
 platform.The company is also touting software improvements on 
the G Flex2, particularly with regard to the camera app. When using the 
front-facing camera, the phone will let you trigger a countdown timer by
 holding up a fist and then unclenching it. This lets you position the 
camera and get a nice shot without reaching for a shutter release 
control on-screen or on the rear. You then only have to lower your hand 
and tilt the phone flat to see the shot you just took. It's a 
particularly clever touch, since the first thing anyone does is check 
the photo they've just taken.There's also Glance view - swipe 
downwards on the screen when the phone is asleep to see important 
information such as upcoming appointments. The G Flex2 runs Android 5.0 
but LG's custom UI is much the same as it has been for the past year or 
so.Under the hood is a 2GHz octa-core Snapdragon 810 SoC, making 
this one of the first devices running it to debut. There will be a 
version with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage and another with 
3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage space. LG's website says that microSD 
cards of up to 2TB are supported, which is the limit of the microSDXC 
format - cards of that capacity are not expected to be available for 
many years.The screen receives a size cut to 5.5 inches, which is
 a lot more manageable, but also a resolution bump up to 1080x1920. This
 is very welcome, especially since we wouldn't have accepted any less on
 a device this premium.The main question that remains unanswered 
about the LG G Flex2 is how it will feel to own and use over a long 
period of time. We will have to wait for a review unit to reach us 
before we can come to any such conclusions. In the brief time we were 
able to spend with a unit tethered to the table at LG's booth, we were 
both impressed and intrigued.Disclosure: LG was showcasing its 
products at MWC 2015 in Barcelona. Qualcomm sponsored the 
correspondent's flights and hotel for Barcelona.
