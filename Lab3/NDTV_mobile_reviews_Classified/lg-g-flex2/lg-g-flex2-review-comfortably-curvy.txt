LG G Flex2 Review: Comfortably Curvy

Last
 year, LG flirted with innovation when it announced the G Flex (Review | Pictures), which 
had a unique 6-inch curved screen. 
However, this phone was an experiment at best and had more than its fair share of 
problems. The 720p screen was no match for its competition, the phone was too unwieldy, and it had an exorbitant 
price tag. After taking a look at the complaints and going back 
to the drawing board, this year LG introduced an upgraded version, the G 
Flex2. This new phone has a smaller footprint and a 1080p display, apart
 from a couple of other improvements. For example, the 
self-healing coating on the rear is more resilient and apparently the 
Gorilla Glass screen protection is tougher. Moreover, the G Flex2 is the first phone using Qualcomm's latest and 
greatest octa-core 64-bit SoC, the Snapdragon 810. Are the curves better on the LG G Flex2? Let's find out. Look and feelLike
 the original, the G Flex2 has a distinctive design mostly thanks to its curve. In our time reviewing it, we found that It turned heads and piqued people's curiosity. The Flamingo Red colour of our review unit was especially 
striking, but the phone is also available in a more subtle silver. Compared to
 the original, the G Flex2 is perceptibly lighter, slimmer, more 
compact, and easier to use with one hand. However, this doesn't mean that 
the phone is suited for one-handed operation.LG has covered the 
rear with a self-healing coating (also present on the G Flex) which
 can recover from scratches. The slimy texture of this coating caused us to 
lose our grip on the phone on a number of occasions. LG claims that the self-healing back now takes just 10 seconds to heal after being 
scratched at room temperature. This is significantly lower 
than G Flex's rating of three minutes. We scratched the back and it did heal 
itself pretty fast but the 10 second estimate feels a little far-fetched. The G 
Flex2 can also bend under pressure applied to its rear, and goes back to its original shape faster than its predecessor did. Just like the LG G2 (Review), G3 (Review | Pictures), and the G 
Flex, the G Flex2 has its power button wedged in between the volume
 controls on the rear. The textured pattern on the volume buttons makes 
it easy to distinguish the from the power button. The tactile feedback
 is pretty decent too. The primary camera lies above this cluster and is 
flanked by the dual-LED flash and the laser autofocus window.The front has a 700mm-radius curvature, while the rear is 
slightly sharper with a 650mm-radius curvature for grip. The
 front of the G Flex 2 is taken up by the 5.5-inch screen and LG 
decided to go with on-screen buttons to navigate 
through the operating system. The earpiece, LED indicator, front camera,
 and the ambient light sensors are all placed above the display.Specifications and softwareThe phone rocks a very powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 octa-core 
processor with four ARM Cortex-A53 cores running at 1.5GHz and four Cortex-A57 
cores running at 2GHz. Completing the SoC is an Adreno 430 GPU. The specific G Flex2 model available in India has 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage 
space, which can be expanded by up to 2TB, according
 to LG. Don't get too excited because only 128GB microSD cards are 
available at the moment. The phone has a plethora of 
sensors: an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a proximity sensor, and a compass. The lack of support
 for 4G on the 2300MHz band is a big letdown because this  means 
that most Indian 4G networks won't be accessible. The
 connectivity options include Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth v4.1
 with aptX, and Infrared. LG has gone with a 13-megapixel primary camera
with optical image stabilisation (OIS) on the rear, ably 
supported by a laser autofocus system lifted from the LG G3, and a dual-LED 
flash. Flip the phone over and you will find a 2.1-megapixel camera on 
the front. The compact body of the phone means that LG had to reduce the
 capacity and size of the battery - the G Flex 2 has a 3000mAh battery 
compared to 3500mAh one on its predecessor. The inch 
curved 5.5-inch P-OLED panel has a resolution of 1080p. It is crisp and 
adequately vibrant, and definitely much better than the screen on the G 
Flex. Thanks to the curve of the screen content just looks immersive. 
Watching videos, reading long articles, and playing games are a treat on
 this curved screen. This is the only real advantage of having a curved 
screen. The viewing angles are top-notch and cranking up the 
brightness keeps reflections under control even under sunlight. The G Flex 2 runs Android
 5.0 Lollipop and LG has slapped its custom UI on top of it. The UI is 
clean and has a flat look, though it's a far cry from the look 
of vanilla Android Lollipop. LG keeps unwanted bloatware to a bare 
minimum which is great. A new software feature called Glance allows 
users to swipe down from the top of the screen when the phone is locked
 to see the status bar and recent notifications. KnockCode (a customised 
code to unlock the phone) and KnockOn (two taps to wake the screen), 
features already introduced by LG in its previous phones, are also present
 here. CameraLG has surprisingly stripped the default 
camera app to its bare basics and there are only three modes - Auto, 
Panorama and Dual. The Dual mode is a new, but not innovative, addition 
to the app which allows users to use both cameras at once to create a
 picture-in-picture image.(Click for full size)The 13-megapixel camera captures some 
good details and natural colours, and can lock focus on a subject really quickly. We think a few people might find the colours a little 
too muted for their taste. We did notice very evident barrel 
distortion along the edges, which was a bit jarring. The HDR mode does a
 great job of protecting images from getting over-exposed due to 
harsh light. (Click for full size)In
 low light, the rear camera does a decent job. We got 
some detailed shots but the camera couldn't do much to reduce noise.
 The OIS also helps. Moreover, the OIS system is a great asset for 
shooting shake-free videos. The quality of 4K videos that we recorded 
was really top-notch but it is a pity that the camera restricts clip length to 5 minutes. The selfies captured by the 2.1-megapixel 
camera were average at best although you can use the in-built beauty 
mode to reduce blemishes on the face. (Click for full size)PerformanceWe were 
eager to test the Snapdragon 810 SoC considering the controversy 
surrounding it. And yes, it has heating issues. Even slightly strenuous 
tasks like capturing images caused the upper portion of the rear to 
heat up. Moreover, processor throttling 
causes simple tasks like swiping the notifications shade down to stutter
 at times. Such erratic performance is unpardonable for a flagship 
device.We have benchmark scores for 
those interested but don't go on these numbers alone to gauge the capabilities 
of the G Flex 2. AnTuTu and Quadrant returned scores of 49,882 and 
29,223 respectively, which are stupendous. As expected 3DMark Ice 
Storm's Basic and Extreme tests were maxed out and in Unlimited the 
phone scored a healthy 17,358. The G Flex2 blazed through all 
our video test files. The sound quality over the loudspeaker was low and
 tinny. The bundled earphones have a great sound and one 
wouldn't need to replace them. The sound quality in calls was really 
good too and the phone does a great job of holding on to the connection 
in congested as well. In our battery test the phone lasted 8 hours and 6 minutes, 
which is lower than what the G Flex achieved indicating that the 
decision to go for a smaller battery was probably wrong. Even in daily 
usage we noticed that the battery life wasn't too great. VerdictLG's attempts to create a viable curved 
smartphone for the masses seem to be thwarted by nagging issues - this 
time it is the performance of the processor. It is not something users 
can't live without but considering the phone costs north of Rs. 50,000, 
such minor shortcomings are unforgivable.Interested buyers can 
pick up the G Flex2 for its novelty factor. Practically, if you have so 
much to spend we'd suggest you take a look at the iPhone 6 (Review | Pictures) or the 
Samsung Galaxy S6 (Review | Pictures) instead. In fact, we'd even recommend the Galaxy S6's 
wackier sibling - the Galaxy S6 Edge (Review | Pictures) - over the LG G Flex2 plainly because it is more stable.
