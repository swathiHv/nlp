XOLO X900 review

The first Intel smartphone is here. After years of work, California 
based Intel announced the first smartphones with its own Atom chips at 
the Mobile World Congress earlier this year. Not able to secure the 
support of popular smartphone manufacturers like HTC and Samsung, 
company went ahead with Chinese tech giant Lenovo and relatively unknown
 Indian manufacturer Lava to launch the initial smartphones.The 
name Lava doesn't inspire much confidence in Indian consumers. While the
 company launched its first smartphone in India last year, it hasn't 
been able to generate much buzz. Intel needed hardware partners, and 
Lava needed a product that would help shed its image of a feature-phone 
manufactuer. In many ways, XOLO is a partnership of convience for both 
sides..X900 is technically the first Intel powered smartphone to 
ship worldwide; it is based on Intel's Medfield reference design and has
 been priced at Rs. 21,999. In this review, we will be find out if the 
first Intel smartphone is capable making a place for Intel in the 
smartphone chip market.HardwareWe have seen quite a few 
beautiful devices in the last few weeks. Coming from Sony's Xperia S, 
Lava XOLO X900 is a tad less aesthetically pleasing but that shouldn't 
be taken as a negative for the smartphone. For a device that 
mirrors the reference design, XOLO X900 looks polished and feels nice in
 hand. The overall design isn't revolutionary but it is some fine work 
and consumers won't be disappointed. Featuring a rectangular 
shape, XOLO X900 reminds of iPhone 4/4S , it is similar in looks with 
the chrome ring, button placement and even the micro-SIM card slot, 
which isn't really bad.The front of the X900 houses a 4.03-inch 
display with 1024x600p resolution, along with capacitive Android 
buttons, 1.3MP front camera, earpiece, MIC and a bunch of sensors. The 
micro-SIM card slot is present on the right side with two-stage 
dedicated camera button, volume rocker and speaker.The matching 
second speaker for stereo sound is present on the left with HDMI-out 
port. The company hasn't clubbed any HDMI cable in the box, which would 
certainly have been a nice addition.Bottom is pretty much clean 
apart from the Micro-USB cum charging port, while top includes power 
button and the 3.5mm headphone jack. On the rubberised back, consumers 
will find the 8MP camera, LED Flash, regulatory symbols, Intel and XOLO 
branding.It might not be the thinnest or lightest phone around, but when it comes with real life usage, XOLO X900 works out pretty well.DisplayIn
 the world of HTC One X and Apple iPhone 4S, manufacturers truly need 
some great work to compete with some really awesome display panels. WVGA
 no longer cuts and HD is the standard - anything less is simply a 
dissapointment for a top of the line smartpone.Intel and Lava 
have opted something that falls in the middle - 1024x600p resolution; it
 is not very common for smartphones, but we have seen it in quite a few 
tablets including Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy Tab 620. It might not 
be 720p HD, but it is not a disappointment either. At its price, X900 
will be competing with Motorola Atrix 2, Samsung Galaxy S Plus, which 
come with qHD and WVGA resolutions - thus X900 surely wins that race.XOLO
 X900 features a 4.03-inch display, which is pretty decent and offers 
nice colour output and viewing angles. Although in comparison with the 
recent smartphones like HTC One X and Galaxy Nexus, we found it a tad 
underwhelming. But then that's a battle no one was expecting the X900 to
 win.As the display has 295 pixels-per-inch, consumers would 
hardly notice any individual pixels on the device. Even the touch 
experience is great and we never had any problems with touch accuracy.XOLO
 X900's display is also sufficiently bright and consumers will not have 
issues while operating the phone directly under the sun.CameraCameras
 have become an integral part of smartphone experience these days, 
manufacturers are spending considerable amount of time and effort in 
bringing something unique and useful to the table. - The ImageSense 
enhancements in HTC One series of smartphones or Pureview technology in 
Nokia 808 are testament to the fact.Intel and Lava have also tried to include their own set of improvements to the camera in X900 - let's see how they worked out.X900
 houses an 8-megapixel camera sensor in the smartphone, which has been 
clubbed with one of the most comprehensive camera apps we have seen in 
recent times. It also comes with something called Burst Shot, last seen 
in HTC One X, that allows consumers to click upto ten pictures in less 
than a second.Lava and Intel even had a dancer at the X900 launch
 to clearly show how effective burst shots can be while taking shots of 
something that is in motion. It was the first feature that we tried on 
X900 and it work flawlessly. Overall, even in non-burst mode, the 
quality of still captures was a tad disappointing. We found it sub-par 
and looking at the cameras in other modern smartphones, it certainly 
lacked a bit.Shots taken from the 5MP camera of Galaxy Nexus were
 better in colour output, vibrancy and details than shots the 8MP camera
 of XOLO X900.The camera app on the smartphone also offers 
various colour filters like Sepia, BW, Negative, which can be applied 
directly in the app itself.The video recording interface on the 
phone is similar to the still imaging UI and it allows you to shoot up 
to 1080p video, which is pretty much a standard in high-end smartphones.
 You can even apply the colour effects while recording a video or set 
white balance or zoom. The recording output is decent and looks good. 
Camera maintains auto-focus continuously, which helps in capturing long 
videos with a lot of movement.The 1.3MP front camera is decent and you can even record 720p videos with it. Software/ InterfaceGive
 us some Ice Cream Sandwich - consumers with old Android phones have 
been shouting the same since November 2011, when ICS source code was 
publically released. Even if we forgive manufacturers for being 
super-late in providing updates for old smartphones, how can they launch
 a new smartphone with old operating system version on-board? Intel
 and Lava have done the same with XOLO X900. When manufacturers like HTC
 could launch their One series of devices with ICS and a comprehensive 
UI on-board, there is no excuse for Intel or Lava to release X900 with 
Gingerbread.Having said that, as a Gingerbread smartphone, XOLO 
X900 is quite decent as company has kept the interface as well the whole
 Android experience pretty much stock. There are no extra applications 
loaded on the smartphone apart from the XOLO Care app and the inclusion 
of Swype.Talking about the app compatibility, being the new 
architecture for Android, there is a lot of confusion on which apps will
 be compatible with the phone's Intel x86 platforms. While apps like 
Facebook, Twitter, Barcode Scanner, Astro, Dropbox, and Instagram work 
flawlessly, several games ,Shadowgun, Deer Hunter, Backstab, Temple 
Run, and Asphalt 6 amongst them, aren't supported as of date.We hope Intel is working proactively with developers to get such apps ready for the platform.Performance /Battery LifeXOLO
 X900 recently became the first smartphone worldwide to ship with 
Intel's Atom Z2460 32nm SoC with processor clocked at up to 1.6 GHz. It 
also comes with a PowerVR SGX 540 GPU at 400 MHz, and a dual channel 
LPDDR2 memory. Despite being powered a single-core processor, 
XOLO X900 performs at par with other smartphones in the same 
price-bracket, which are powered by dual-core processors. There is 
no-sluggishness or lag while going through menus or working with the 
applications.Even before Intel entered the smartphone arena, a 
lot of questions were raised around the battery life of any future 
phones based on Intel processors. x86 has traditionally been seen as a 
power hungry platform, not suitable for use in smartphones and other 
devices where battery juice is at a premium.The x86 power myth 
also seems busted as X900's battery backup is inline with any other 
competing high-end Android smartphone. Medium to heavy users will be 
able to pass the day with the smartphone's 1460 mAh battery.The 
gaming performance in pretty good and most casual games worked 
flawlessly; although, we did miss many popular gaming titles because of 
incompatibility with the architecture.Intel has clearly taken a 
big step with the first smartphone and it is certainly a worthy 
competitor, but there are few things that it needs work on - like app 
compatibility.VerdictWhile the Lava XOLO X900 performs 
pretty well for its price, the positioning as well as the branding might
 well end up hurting the phone. Although Lava has pitched it under the 
name XOLO, Indian consumers are very brand conscious and a 'Lava-made 
Rs. 22,000 phone' factor will surely play a lot of role in their buying 
decision. But, if you can look beyond the brand, XOLO X900 is worthy of 
consideration.Check out more images of Lava XOLO X900 in our picture gallery.ProsQuality displayOverall performanceConsCameraDated Gingerbread on board Lack of compatibility with select appsRatingsDesign: 3Display: 3.5Camera: 3Performance: 3.5Software: 3Battery Life: 3.5Value for Money: 3Ecosystem: 3Overall: 3.5
